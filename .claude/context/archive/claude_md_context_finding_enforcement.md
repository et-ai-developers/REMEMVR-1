### Context

**Problem:** Prior CLAUDE.md framed context-finding as optional/situational
**Solution:** Made context-finding MANDATORY for every user request
**Impact:** Reduces back-and-forth, leverages existing documentation, demonstrates proactive thinking

---

### Workflow Enforced

```
1. User: "Do XYZ"
2. I think: "What questions do I have?"
3. I invoke context-finder agent (MANDATORY)
4. I review findings
5. I ask user ONLY unanswered questions
6. I proceed with full context
```

**Files Modified:**
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (4 locations updated)

**Result:** Context-finding workflow now mandatory, preventing premature responses without proper documentation search
