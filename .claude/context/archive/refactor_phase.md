### Summary

**Goal:** Reorganize codebase from monolithic scripts to modular tool suite

**What Happened:**
- Created `tools/` package (modular analysis functions)
- Created `config/` directory (YAML configs)
- Archived legacy code to `_archive/legacy_code/`
- Created `results/chX/rqY/` structure for 50 RQs
- Set up Poetry for package management
- Established context management system

**Key Decisions:**
See decisions.md (D001-D027) for full refactor decisions (NOTE: These are archived separately, not in this system as they predate the Memory System Overhaul)

**Status:** Refactor complete. Moved to automation development phase (Jan 2025).

**Archived from:** `.context/phases/refactor/info.md`
**Original Date:** 2025-11-05 (estimated from context)
**Reason:** Historical milestone - refactor complete before automation phases began
