1.1	EPISODIC MEMORY
Through the lens of a neuroscientist, try to recall what you ate for lunch two days ago. Notice the strategies your mind employs to find an answer. For myself, the process begins semantically, first identifying which day of the week is being investigated, followed by a consideration of my whereabouts around midday. Once a familiar congruence between temporal and spatial information occurs, a vast repository of associated experiences is unlocked that I can peruse within my mind’s eye. Not only can I now recall the meal, but also who I was with, what was discussed, and where I was sitting. Even my emotional state appears to have been recorded somewhere in my brain without any deliberate effort at the time to commit this information to memory. This seemingly effortless act of recall is one of the most extraordinary capabilities of the human mind. Yet, despite its richness and ubiquity, the inherent subjectivity, reconstructive nature, and neural complexity of this behaviour continues to challenge science’s ability to understand the precise mechanisms by which we encode, retrieve, and reconstruct past experiences [REF]. This autonoetic experience, the reliving of personal events situated in time and space, is known as episodic memory (EM) and is foundation of our autobiographical self [REF].
"In that vast chamber of my memory… there also do I meet with myself, and recall myself, what, when, or where I did a thing, and how I was affected when I did it”. Saint Augustine’s words from 397 AD help contextualise the longevity of humanity’s desire to understand this innate ability of mental time travel [REF]. Centuries of philosophy and decades of science continue to refine our understanding of this remarkable property of consciousness, with recent advances in technology accelerating this progress. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have revealed a vast and complex network of interactions between distal brain regions during the encoding, storage, and retrieval of episodic memories [REF]. While measurement of episodic memory’s physical properties continues to flourish alongside advanced imaging techniques, behavioural measurement has struggled to bridge the gap between experimental control and real-world use [REF]. Recent innovations in immersive virtual reality (iVR) now offer an unprecedented opportunity to study episodic memory in a manner that can overcome the historical imbalance between ecological validity and standardised utility by simulating life-like experiences while maintaining essential empirical controls [REF].
This thesis explores a new frontier of episodic memory behavioural measurement through the development and validation of REMEMVR (the Ronayne Ecological Metric for Episodic Memory using Virtual Reality). The following chapters examine the theoretical underpinnings of episodic memory, evaluate current measurement limitations, and demonstrate how the careful development, application, and interpretation of a tool such as REMEMVR can not only standardise subjective episodic memory phenomena, but also refine the interpretation of traditional assessment methods. By integrating cognitive neuroscience, virtual reality, and behavioural testing, this work aims to advance the science and practice of episodic memory behavioural measurement.
1.2	HOW IS EPISODIC MEMORY DEFINED?
“If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things.” Confucius' words highlight a fundamental challenge in episodic memory research [REF]. While recalling what you ate for lunch is intuitively distinct from other cognitive processes, drawing precise theoretical boundaries around what qualifies as episodic memory, and what does not, is an essential yet complex task. This complexity arises because episodic memory shares many features with other labelled forms of memory, such as semantic memory and autobiographical memory, making clear distinctions difficult [REF]. Moreover, as empirical research continues to reshape our understanding of episodic neural architecture, past definitions frequently updated to reflect the latest evidence [REF]. As a result, the meaning of ‘episodic memory’ in academic literature often depends on the author’s focus and year of publication [REF]. In recognition of the complexity, diversity, and ongoing evolution of episodic memory nomenclature, it is necessary to first establish a common understanding between author and reader. This section explores the most common perspectives of episodic memory and clarifies how the term ‘episodic memory’ is applied in the context of this research.
[FIGURE OF MULTIPLE MEMORY SYSTEMS MODEL]
1.2.1	Taxonomic Definition
The oldest and most common definition of episodic memory originates from its classification within the multiple memory systems model [REF]. This framework assumes that memory is not a single, undifferentiated faculty but rather a set of specialised subsystems, each handling particular types of information [REF]. Originally, this model classified declarative memory, long-term memories retrieved via conscious recollection, as a singular subsystem [REF]. Endel Tulving was the first to formally recognise the need to distinguish between knowing general facts and remembering personal experiences [REF]. While both acts are declarative in nature, Tulving argued that the significant contextual and experiential differences between the two forms of conscious recollection justified a theoretical distinction [REF]. Tulving thus divided declarative memory into two subsystems based on whether the content was factual general knowledge (semantic memory), or if the content was a re-living of past experiences (episodic memory) [REF].
Tulving’s modification to the multiple memory systems model quickly gained popularity in the scientific community. The newly coined episodic and semantic memory domains allowed researchers to focus on each system individually, and enabled clinicians to more appropriately label observations in patients [REF]. Furthermore, several popular lesion case-studies, such as H.M. and K.C., showed it was possible to have impairment in episodic recall, but intact semantic recall [REF]. These single dissociations were often interpreted as evidence that a differentiation between semantic and episodic memory was more than a useful heuristic, but a biological reality [REF].
While the simplicity of a dichotomous distinction between semantic and episodic memory remains somewhat practical, modern research into their underlying anatomical and cognitive architecture has all but erased the idea of biological independence [REF]. It is now understood that episodic and semantic memories are highly interdependent, engaging many overlapping cortical regions, and involve similar reconstructive, relational, and multimodal processes [REF] [W3007266467]. Semantic knowledge often shapes the context of how episodic events are interpreted and stored [REF]. For example, when watching a game of chess, your semantic knowledge of the rules gives meaning to the experience which is then stored as an episodic memory. Similarly, episodic memories often transition into stable semantic structures [REF]. For example, after playing many games of chess, your episodic memory allows the identification of patterns and strategies which append to your semantic knowledge. In other words, you now know chess strategy without needing to recall any specific game.
This fluidity between theoretically distinct episodic and semantic memory systems was addressed with the introduction of autobiographical memory as a third form of declarative memory [REF]. The autobiographical system argues that when recalling the episodic what-when-where of past experiences, these memories are contextualised within a system of self-identity that contains both semantic and episodic components [REF]. For example, when recalling a past birthday, knowing it was your 21st birthday is semantic, remembering blowing out the candles is episodic, and remembering how the event shaped the beginning of your adulthood is autobiographical.
Definition via anecdote as employed above is common in declarative memory literature [REF]. Their utility in placing a memory within one specific system, while intuitive, shows how their foundation is essentially derived from heuristics [REF]. Taxonomic classification continues to be an essential tool for scientific research; however, most taxonomic systems are defined by objective measurement rather than subjective experience [REF]. Tulving himself later lamented that a dichotomous approach to labelling declarative memories is not entirely representative of physical evidence [REF]. While the simplicity of a taxonomic perspective is often appropriate for conceptual episodic memory discourse, functional neuroimaging data undermines the multiple memory systems model’s implication that semantic, episodic, and autobiographical memory are physically different cognitive processes [REF].
1.2.2	Anatomical Definition
Considering the caveats in episodic memory’s taxonomic definition, another approach is to define episodic memory by its neural components. The case-studies that originally supported episodic and semantic compartmentalisation correctly identified the medial temporal lobe (MTL), encompassing the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex, as a central hub for episodic encoding, consolidation, and recall [REF]. Prior to neuroimaging data, individuals with MTL damage provided some of the most compelling evidence of two distinct cognitive and biological systems [REF]. Classic cases of MTL damage (e.g., patient H.M.) illustrated severe episodic deficits alongside relatively intact semantic knowledge, suggesting that while the MTL is crucial for forming rich contextual memories, it was less vital for maintaining or retrieving general facts [REF].
As discussed in 1.3.1, the MTL indeed plays a pivotal role in binding and retrieving the disparate elements of lived experience, integrating semantics, locations, and temporal markers into a unified memory trace. However, defining episodic memory as cognition produced by the MTL’s anatomy risks reducing the experience to its ‘hardware’. The subjective and reconstructive dimension of remembering, shaped by attention, emotion, and personal relevance, is yet to be fully explained by neuroanatomical maps alone [REF]. Modern frameworks, as discussed in 1.3.3, address these limitations by integrating evidence of the MTL’s role within broader networks that include the prefrontal cortex, parietal regions, and the default mode network. Such distributed connectivity highlights how episodic memory involves more than just storing and retrieving event details [REF]. In fact, it incorporates attention, self-referential processing, and the emotional salience that colours our past experiences. Consequently, while the MTL remains central to any anatomical definition of episodic memory, it represents only one facet of a multifaceted system that supports the active, subjective, and often reconstructive nature of remembering events from our past [REF].
1.2.3	Categorical Definition
Acknowledging the problems of strictly taxonomic and anatomical definitions of episodic memory, Conway (2009) [REF] offered a more nuanced Aristotelian/Categorical definition. According to this perspective, episodic memories are memories that meet the following criteria:
1. Contain summary records of sensory-perceptual-conceptual-affective processing.
2. Retain patterns of activation/inhibition over long periods.
3. Often represented in the form of (visual) images.
4. Always have a perspective (field or observer).
5. Represent short time slices of experience.
6. They are represented on a temporal dimension roughly in order of occurrence.
7. They are subject to rapid forgetting.
8. They make autobiographical remembering specific.
9. They are recollectively experienced when accessed.
While Conway’s checklist brings conceptual clarity and untangles some caveats inherent in the taxonomic approach, it introduces new challenges for empirical application. The motivation for such a checklist was to better delineate declarative memory systems by offering observable features of episodic memory [REF]. However, several of these features, such as “recollective experience” (9), “perspective” (4), and “autobiographical specificity” (8), are inherently subjective and rely on introspective reporting. This introduces variability across participants and contexts, complicating objective classification in behavioural or neuroimaging studies.
Moreover, empirical usage of this checklist often involves retrospective classification: researchers apply the criteria post hoc to determine whether a memory is “episodic.” In doing so, they risk circular reasoning, e.g., using feature (8) to define episodic memory by its contribution to autobiographical remembering, while simultaneously treating autobiographical memory as partially defined by the presence of episodic content. This mutual dependence blurs definitional boundaries and limits explanatory power [REF].
Ultimately, while Conway’s categorical definition reflects episodic memory’s theoretical richness and aligns well with the phenomenology of memory, its application in empirical research can be constrained by subjectivity, circularity, and a lack of clear neurocognitive mapping [REF]. This highlights a broader challenge for memory science: how to define and measure episodic memory in ways that are both theoretically valid and empirically tractable.
1.2.4	Functional Definition
A functional perspective defines episodic memory not by its structure or content, but by the role it plays in cognition, specifically, what it enables an organism to do [REF]. From this viewpoint, episodic memory is understood as an adaptive system shaped by the evolutionary need to recognise patterns and predict future outcomes [REF]. Human cognitive success is frequently attributed to this predictive capacity, and much of the brain’s architecture is thought to be optimised for such pattern recognition [REF]. Within the domain of declarative memory, patterns of lived experience enhance recall and inform decision-making in ways that support survival and long-term planning.
Rather than opposing taxonomic, anatomical, or categorical definitions, the functional approach reframes episodic memory as a flexible and dynamic process. It allows for fluid boundaries between types of declarative information, all contributing to the broader goal of predictive modelling. The capacity to mentally revisit the past and simulate the future offers an adaptive advantage, and this capacity is widely considered to be a defining feature of human cognition [REF].
Importantly, episodic recall is not a literal reproduction of past experience. It is a reconstructive process, in which fragments of stored information are integrated and supplemented by inference to produce a coherent narrative [REF]. This reconstruction enables memory to operate in a resource-efficient manner, but it also introduces distortions. With each act of remembering, new information may be encoded alongside retrieved content, resulting in a gradual transformation of the original memory trace [REF]. This phenomenon helps explain both the general decline in episodic accuracy over time and the susceptibility of memory to post hoc suggestion.
The functional perspective also highlights two components that extend beyond simple recall: episodic forgetting and meta-memory. Episodic forgetting refers to the selective loss of information that no longer contributes to current or future goals [REF], while meta-memory encompasses the ability to monitor and evaluate the reliability of one's own recollections [REF]. Both are crucial for adaptive behaviour and are discussed in detail in later chapters.
Although a definition based solely on function does not resolve all ambiguities, particularly those concerning the boundaries between episodic memory, imagination, and future thinking, it offers a pragmatic and ecologically valid framework for research [REF]. By conceptualising episodic memory as an adaptive, bi-temporal process, this perspective emphasises its utility in real-world cognition and clinical application, rather than imposing rigid theoretical constraints.
1.2.5	Conclusion
The diversity amongst the taxonomic, anatomical, categorical, and functional perspectives on episodic memory underscore its amorphous and evolving nature as a concept in cognitive neuroscience. Each vantage point offers meaningful insights, taxonomic frameworks describe where episodic memory fits among other memory systems, anatomical definitions identify the neural correlates that enable episodic encoding, storage, and recall, categorical checklists highlight distinguishing features useful for specific discussion, and functional considerations reveal an evolutionary incentive. 
While it is beyond the scope of this thesis to offer any new definition of episodic memory, modern thinking points toward a gradient from semantic to episodic, rather than dichotomous boundaries. That is, episodic memories can range from richly detailed to severely degraded or incorrect representations of past experiences and contain varying degrees of semantic, autobiographical and spatiotemporal information. Broadly speaking, they are a fluid reconstruction between a memory of “what happened” bound to “where” and “when” type information, with varying degrees of familiarity to help separate fact from fiction [REF].
In summary, this thesis discusses episodic memory from a functional perspective, focusing on how recollection operates, how it is influenced by the passage of time, how it fluctuates from day to day, how it accommodates incomplete details, and how metamemory plays a role in assessing the reliability of an episodic memory. This flexible framework is especially well suited to exploring the properties of REMEMVR’s immersive virtual reality paradigm outlined in the following chapters. The goal for this definition is to facilitate discussion of real-world episodic memory performance without strictly isolating episodic from semantic. By prioritizing adaptiveness, real-world applicability, and subjective awareness, the functional perspective offers the most fitting foundation for understanding and investigating episodic memory within this research context.
1.3	HOW DOES EPISODIC MEMORY WORK?
The challenge of precisely describing how episodic memory operates stems not only from definitional complexities (Section 1.2) but also from the intricate interplay of neural circuits and cognitive processes involved. Rather than seeking a single mechanism, contemporary research acknowledges that episodic memory emerges from a system of interacting mechanisms, spanning both “physical anatomy” (brain structures and their microcircuitry) and “cognitive anatomy” (the processes of encoding, consolidation, and recall) [REF]. This section explores how these anatomies intersect to create our capacity to remember personal experiences, concluding with key theoretical frameworks that attempt to explain the orchestration of episodic memory at multiple levels of analysis.
1.3.1	Physical Anatomy
Historically, the hippocampus has long been considered the central player in episodic memory. This is largely due to two famous clinical cases. H.M., who had his hippocampi removed to treat severe epilepsy, lost the ability to form new memories but retained many older ones, revealing that while the hippocampus is crucial for new episodic learning, it does not act entirely alone [REF]. K.C., on the other hand, displayed striking deficits in forming new episodic memories following damage to his hippocampus yet was able to form new procedural and semantic memories, suggesting that different facets of memory may recruit distinct but overlapping brain systems [REF]. An important caveat to note in both case studies is that while the forming of new ‘non-episodic’ memories was indeed possible, learning was significantly impaired and only achieved via extensive task repetition [REF]. These stories, while often used as evidence of dissociability between episodic and semantic memory systems, show that episodic memory is not an isolated function produced by a single region of the brain but rather emerges from a network of cooperating and overlapping cortical structures that work together to produce a range of cognitive behaviours [REF].
[FIGURE OF EPISODIC ANATOMY INCLUDING ALL REGIONS DISCUSSED BELOW]
1.3.1.1	Hippocampal Network
The understanding of episodic memory’s physical anatomy has expanded far beyond the hippocampus. While it is undoubtably one of the key regions for episodic cognition, it is surrounded by a sophisticated arrangement of anatomical structures all that cooperate to encode, store, and retrieve the tapestry of our past experiences [REF]. Rather than acting as a simple relay station, the hippocampal network functions more like an intricate ensemble, integrating signals from widespread cortical regions and returning a refined, coherent output that can be stored as long-term memory in the cortex [REF].
Information flows into this network from numerous cortical areas carrying the sights, sounds, emotions, and spatial layouts of an event. The hippocampus and surrounding structures then bind these details into a cohesive memory trace [REF]. The network also sends a variety of information back out to the wider cortex, facilitating memory consolidation, reconstruction, and conscious recollection [REF]. This bidirectional nature underscores the dynamic nature of episodic memory processes. Far from facilitating a faithful and unchanging record of lived experience, the hippocampal network filters new information through learned contextual lenses and uses semantic patterns to “fill in the blanks” during memory reconstruction [REF].
1.3.1.1.1	Hippocampus
Within the hippocampal network, the bilateral hippocampi can be analogised as the “conductors” of a wider episodic memory orchestra. Rather than acting as a storage mechanism, the hippocampus is primarily involved in the coordination and information integration of the wider hippocampal network [REF]. This is evidenced by the many cases of unilateral hippocampal removal in epilepsy patients, resulting a relatively minimal impact on episodic recall when compared to bilateral hippocampal damage which is catastrophic for episodic cognition [REF]. The hippocampus can thus be considered critical for the encoding and recall of episodic memories but is less involved in physical storage of information.
Much like how a maestro coordinates musicians in an orchestra to play a symphony, the hippocampus synchronises and routes key sensory, spatial, and emotional information between critical nodes in the hippocampal network to facilitate episodic processes [REF]. Without a conductor, the musicians lose harmony and the song becomes unrecognisable. This further explains why bilateral hippocampal damage causes significant impairment in episodic memory. The damage has not “erased” any memories but instead prevents the wider network from interacting in a coordinated and synchronised manner to produce familiar recollections.
The neural architecture of the hippocampus itself is incredibly complex and much is still unknown [REF]. fMRI studies however have managed to identify several key regions that are associated with different components of episodic memory. For example, CA1 integrates cues from other hippocampal subfields and the entorhinal cortex, helping bind the “when” and “where” of an event into a single memory trace, evidenced by the firing of internal place-cell and time-cell structures during encoding and recall [REF]. CA3 works closely with CA1, specialising in pattern completion to help memory reactivation from minimal cues. This is achieved via an ability to form auto associative networks across a region of pyramidal neurons [REF]. This recurrent collateral network allows for ‘in-house’ associations to be made between conceptually orthogonal types of information [REF]. For example, when remembering what you had for lunch two days ago, one might recall a topic of conversation, and by association, the meal you ate while it was discussed.
1.3.1.1.2	Dentate Gyrus
When performing a task like remembering where you parked your car, a variety of very similar memories can come to mind. The dentate gyrus is specialised in separating similar memories into discrete episodes, allowing you to separate where you parked today versus yesterday. This is achieved through pattern separation, a process that keeps similar events from overlapping [REF]. This subtle discrimination is critical for accurate episodic encoding and recall. If the dentate gyrus did not “separate” these experiences, we might fuse them into a single blurred memory. 
1.3.1.1.3	Entorhinal Cortex
The entorhinal cortex is often referred to as the gateway to the hippocampus, providing the major channels by which information enters and exits the hippocampal network. Within the entorhinal cortex, two subdivisions play distinct roles. The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) encodes spatial and temporal context, while the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) handles object-based and sensory details [REF]. Together, they funnel a diverse array of information into the hippocampus, organising a diverse range of bi-directional information to facilitate richly detailed episodic memories.
1.3.1.1.4	Parahippocampal Gyrus
While the hippocampus may conduct and the entorhinal cortex may provide the gateway, the parahippocampal gyrus contributes the toward spatial cognition and environmental context. This region, which encompasses the parahippocampal cortex proper, integrates visual and spatial information [REF]. Notably, the perirhinal cortex, often grouped with the parahippocampal gyrus, is essential for recognizing objects and determining familiarity, helping us recognize when a place, face, or item is something we have encountered before [REF]. This integration of spatial, contextual, and object-based information helps paint a full backdrop against which the hippocampus can orchestrate detailed episodic memories.
1.3.1.1.5	Subiculum
At the downstream end of the hippocampus lies the subiculum, an often under-appreciated but essential component of the memory network. The subiculum directs the flow of information between the hippocampus and broader cortical circuits [REF]. Once the hippocampus has constructed or retrieved a memory “piece,” the subiculum ensures that this output is efficiently shared with other regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and parietal areas, where it can influence decision-making or blend with ongoing cognitive processes [REF]. In essence, without the subiculum, the finely orchestrated work of the hippocampus might remain confined, never reaching the broader neural world that allows us to act on our recollections or integrate them with our sense of self. In this way, the subiculum completes the memory loop.
1.3.2	Cognitive Anatomy
If the physical anatomy of episodic memory describes who is involved and where in the brain these interactions occur, the cognitive anatomy details how they unfold across three broad stages, encoding, consolidation, and recall. These stages are not purely sequential, instead interacting dynamically and are influenced by many factors such as, attention, working memory, cognitive control, emotional state, environmental factors, motivation, and an individual’s broader cognitive capacities [REF]. This section will outline how episodic memories are formed, reorganized, and retrieved in service of predicting future outcomes to guide real-world behaviour.
1.3.2.1	Encoding
Encoding refers to the initial formation of a memory trace from raw sensory input and internal states. During this phase, the brain integrates diverse visual, auditory, emotional and contextual elements into a cohesive representation [REF]. For instance, consider a routine lunch in a new café. Attention determines which aspects are encoded in detail (e.g., the café layout, the aroma of food, the conversation with a friend). Emotion can amplify certain features (e.g., a surprising event at the café becomes more memorable). Context (location, time of day, social setting) becomes part of the encoded memory through the principle of encoding specificity, meaning later recall is often facilitated if that original context or similar cues are reinstated [REF].
To relate back to physical anatomy, subfields within the hippocampus and dentate gyrus respond selectively to different components of the experience. Place cells or time cells in CA1 may signal the location or temporal sequence of events [REF]. Object-responsive neurons in surrounding medial temporal lobe regions highlight key items or people [REF]. Meanwhile, the prefrontal cortex and other “extrahippocampal” networks coordinate executive functions, filtering relevant from irrelevant information [REF]. Elaborative rehearsal strategies (e.g., relating the café visit to prior experiences, noticing personal relevance) further strengthen the memory trace [REF]. Encoding is thus shaped by both intrinsic factors (attention, motivation, affect) and extrinsic factors (environmental cues, novelty, social context) [REF].
1.3.2.2	Consolidation
Once formed, memories do not remain static. Consolidation involves both short-term stabilization and longer-term reorganization of newly encoded traces. These are typically categorised as synaptic consolidation and systems consolidation. Synaptic consolidation typically occurs within hours of encoding. During this window, synaptic modifications are biochemically stabilized, preventing newly formed memories from fading [REF]. Disruptions (e.g., extreme stress or interference) can weaken these synaptic changes [REF]. Systems consolidation unfolds over days, weeks, or even years. During this more prolonged phase, cortical reorganization gradually reduces direct reliance on the hippocampus [REF]. This might explain why some old episodic memories remain accessible in cases of bilateral hippocampal damage [REF]. According to the standard consolidation model, remote memories eventually become independent of the hippocampus. By contrast, Multiple Trace Theory (MTT) argues that the hippocampus remains crucial for retrieving richly detailed episodic memories regardless of their age, with each retrieval creating new hippocampal traces [REF]. More recently, hybrid or transformation models have emerged, suggesting that older memories often become less reliant on the hippocampus for their gist or semantic content, yet the hippocampus can still undergird vivid, context-rich retrieval if such detail is required [REF]. These various framework perspectives are discussed in more detail in section 1.3.3.
Consolidation is further shaped by sleep (particularly slow-wave sleep and associated sharp-wave ripples, which appear to “replay” recent experiences and promote hippocampal–cortical dialogue) [REF]. Furthermore, stress and stress hormones can also either reinforce or disrupt consolidation, depending on factors like timing and intensity [REF].
1.3.2.3	Recall
Recall is the process by which an existing memory trace is accessed/reactivated, often from minimal cues. Rather than a simple replay, episodic recall is inherently constructive [REF]. As discussed in 1.3.1.1.1, the hippocampus’ CA3 region facilitates the reinstatement of an entire memory from partial input (e.g., seeing a photo of the café reactivates the entire mental scene). This information is then passed to the prefrontal cortex to orchestrate strategic retrieval, cue-search, and verification (e.g., evaluating whether a recalled detail is accurate or confounded by another event) [REF]. This results in two key cognitive processes, recollecting specific contextual details, and familiarity, a more global sense of prior exposure without the fine-grained context.
Importantly, recall can also alter the memory trace itself, where newly retrieved memories are temporarily labile and subject to modification [REF]. This ongoing update process enables adaptation (updating with new insights) but also opens the door to errors and distortions (misattributions, intrusions). Environmental context, current emotional or motivational states, and cognitive goals all shape how, and how accurately, past events are reconstructed.
1.3.3	Frameworks
As seen in previous chapters, episodic cognition is a highly complex behaviour produced by a variety of regions across the brain. This intricate network performs several conceptually orthogonal tasks to encode, consolidate, and recall past experiences. In response to the ever-developing body of evidence, several competing theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain how the brain manages the complex processes underlying episodic memory. Some focus on large-scale networks, others emphasize the hippocampus’s enduring role, and still others explore how mental scenes are constructed. While no single model has universal acceptance among memory researchers [REF], each model offers its own explanation of how the contextually rich facets of what, when, and where information are handled at a theoretical level, fuelling ongoing debates and shaping future research directions.
1.3.3.1	The PMAT Framework (Poldrak & Ritchie)
[FIGURE OF THE PMAT SYSTEM]
The Posterior Medial–Anterior Temporal (PMAT) [REF] framework proposes two interlinked networks that support the content and context of episodic memory. The posterior medial (PM) system involves regions like the parahippocampal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and posterior cingulate, emphasizing spatial and temporal contexts. The anterior temporal (AT) system includes the perirhinal cortex, lateral temporal regions, and amygdala, focusing on object- and emotion-related information.
Neuroimaging findings (e.g., Ritchey & Ranganath, 2012) suggest these networks are differentially activated during episodic recall, reflecting how factual versus contextual details are processed. PMAT’s strength lies in mapping large-scale circuits onto anatomically plausible subdivisions, revealing how the memory trace can be viewed from different angles. However, critics note that PMAT downplays the role of prefrontal and parietal regions, which influence central memory encoding and retrieval processes via executive control and attentional allocation [REF]. Moreover, how PMAT aligns or conflicts with other memory models (e.g., Multiple Trace Theory) remains underexplored [REF]. Some recent work suggests that integrating prefrontal areas into PMAT might better explain top-down steering of episodic retrieval, especially under novel or goal-driven conditions [REF].
New research that systematically manipulates what and where factors in virtual environments is allowing researchers to observe whether the PM or AT system shows stronger activation or connectivity [REF]. This could clarify how semantic (object) information interacts with contextual (spatiotemporal) cues during immersive memory tasks, potentially enriching PMAT’s account of real-world remembering.
1.3.3.2	Multiple Trace Theory (Nadel & Moscovitch)
Multiple Trace Theory (MTT) [REF] challenges the idea that episodic memories become fully independent of the hippocampus over time. Instead, MTT posits that each retrieval lays down a new hippocampal trace, preserving this region’s involvement throughout the memory’s lifespan. This perspective explains why repeatedly recalled events often gain in vividness as every act of recall re-encodes and potentially modifies the original trace. Indeed, anecdotal and clinical evidence shows certain remote autobiographical memories can remain strikingly detailed, consistently engaging the hippocampus even decades later.
However, critics highlight clinical observations and experimental data suggesting that some older memories can be accessed in the absence of a fully functional hippocampus [REF]. For instance, patients with significant hippocampal damage sometimes retain partially intact remote memories (e.g., Squire & Bayley, 2007). These mixed findings underscore the debate: Is the hippocampus ever truly relinquished for episodic details, or are these memories increasingly semanticised with the memory trace becoming increasingly stored in the wider cortex with less processing required by the hippocampal network?
Virtual reality offers an innovative way to test MTT’s predictions. By allowing repeated re-encoding or re-exposure to the same immersive event, one can track whether hippocampal engagement diminishes or remains essential over multiple retrievals. If VR-based neuroimaging reveals hippocampal traces persist for even well-rehearsed events, that would bolster MTT; conversely, if cortical networks gradually dominate retrieval, it might support more standard consolidation views or hybrid approaches (e.g., trace transformation theory).
1.3.3.3	Scene Construction Theory (Maguire & Hassabis)
Scene Construction Theory (SCT) [REF] focuses on how the hippocampus orchestrates the assembly of spatial and contextual elements into a coherent mental scene. According to SCT, the same neural machinery supporting spatial navigation (e.g., place cells, grid cells) also underlies imaginative reconstructions. In other words, recalling a past birthday party or envisioning a novel scenario utilise highly overlapped neural and cognitive processes. Neuroimaging studies indeed show hippocampal activation not only for autobiographical recall but also for tasks involving scene imagination [REF]. This past-future phenomenon supports the functional perspective, that patterns of past experiences are applied to imagining future scenarios. 
A major strength of SCT is its explanation of why hippocampal lesions can impair both episodic recollection and future-thinking/scene building. Critics argue, however, that SCT might underemphasize factors that shape how we interpret or prioritize scene elements. That is, the emotional, semantic, and executive processes [REF]. For instance, emotional salience can distort or highlight certain parts of an imagined scenario, beyond purely spatial or contextual considerations [REF].
Immersive VR environments can directly probe the scene-construction process by offering precise manipulations of spatial layouts, object placements, and emotional cues. Researchers can measure time spent exploring or vividness ratings in VR-based tasks to detect deficits in scene construction, particularly in clinical populations (e.g., hippocampal amnesia). Such experiments could also clarify how the hippocampus integrates non-spatial dimensions (like personal relevance or affect) into constructed memories.
1.3.3.4	Emerging and Hybrid Perspectives
While PMAT, MTT, and SCT each capture distinct aspects of episodic memory, recent theoretical research has proposed hybrid or integrative models that bridge the gaps between these frameworks. For example, trace transformation theory combines ideas from MTT and standard consolidation, proposing that old memories undergo structural change, retaining some hippocampal dependence for vivid details while shifting semantic content to the cortex [REF]. Likewise, network-based theories incorporate SCT’s spatial scaffolding with PMAT’s large-scale circuits, positing that scene construction occurs within specialized sub-networks modulated by higher-level executive regions [REF].
Understanding where these frameworks converge (e.g., hippocampal-cortical interplay) or diverge (e.g., scene-based vs. semantic-based emphasis) can be used to inform the design of measurement tools like REMEMVR. By blending controlled VR experiments with behavioural analyses and neuroimaging data, researchers can evaluate how different theoretical predictions align with real-world memory performance. Future studies may thereby refine these models or inspire entirely new conceptualizations of how the human brain encodes, consolidates, and reconstructs episodic experiences.
1.3.4	Conclusion
Episodic memory emerges from an intricate interplay of physical anatomy, with the hippocampal network at its core, and cognitive anatomy, involving encoding, consolidation, and recall processes shaped by a myriad of factors. The theoretical frameworks surveyed in this chapter, PMAT, Multiple Trace Theory, Scene Construction Theory, and newly emerging hybrid models, demonstrate the diverse ways in which researchers have attempted to explain how the brain handles the richly contextual details of what, when, and where of episodic memory. Although each model offers unique insights, the academic consensus is that none fully captures the complexities of a phenomenon that integrates such distributed cortical areas, dynamic neural coding, and richly contextual information.
Among these models, the PMAT framework currently represents one of the most empirically robust and comprehensive accounts of how distinct anatomical networks might handle object-focused versus spatial-temporal information. Yet MTT’s emphasis on enduring hippocampal involvement and SCT’s focus on spatial scene construction each highlight crucial facets of episodic experience that PMAT only partially addresses. Integrative or hybrid perspectives, such as trace transformation theory, further underscores that episodic memory likely depends on shifting hippocampal–cortical relationships over time, reflecting both spatial and semantic transformation.
From a functional perspective, episodic memory can be viewed as a complex, integrative cognitive function, balancing adaptive forgetting, meta-memory judgments, and context-sensitive recall. Its complexity, however, also makes it vulnerable to distortions and neurological disruptions. In this light, new experimental methods, including iVR paradigms (e.g., REMEMVR) can be explored to refine and reconcile conflicting theoretical claims by enabling controlled, yet ecologically valid, manipulations of context, cue salience, and repeated retrievals.  
Looking ahead, further research must probe how these frameworks might merge or evolve to encompass the full breadth of episodic memory phenomena, including how individual differences, emotional salience, and executive control shape our recollection of past events. By uniting theoretical models with advanced measurement tools, the field stands to make significant strides in clarifying both the underlying architecture of episodic memory and the avenues for clinical and real-world applications.
1.4	HOW IS EPISODIC MEMORY MEASURED?
As seen in the previous chapters, episodic memory is a rich, complex, and deeply subjective phenomena, making accurate assessment of individual ability difficult to metricise. Furthermore, evolving definitions and emerging theories continue to shift the goalposts of episodic memory metrics. This chapter aims to explore why measurement is essential, how episodic memory has been measured in the past, and how it is measured currently.
1.4.1	Importance of Measurement
“If it cannot be measured, it cannot be improved” – Lord Kelvin. 
Measurement is the act that separates science from philosophy. If modern understanding of episodic memory is to be an empirical science, an objective and standardised measurement method is critical. The accuracy and validity of these measurements are critical for a variety of decision-making in both a clinical and a research content.
1.4.1.1	Clinical
1.4.1.1.1	Dementia
Episodic impairment is often the first cognitive ability to become impaired in prodromal dementia [REF]. Currently most dementia assessments are relatively coarse in their detection of episodic impairment, relying on more traditional methods as discussed in 1.4.3. The downside of this coarseness is that impairment must be significant to be detected in the resulting score, leaving subtle impairment difficult to determine [REF]. Therefore, using less sensitive episodic memory metrics as a diagnostic tool risks significant delay in allocating a treatment plan to a patient. Furthermore, any ongoing treatment designed to delay the progression of dementia must be assessed regularly to determine the efficacy of the prescribed approach. Thus, using episodic memory performance as a litmus test for prodromal dementia requires the test to be sensitive enough to detect early signs of impairment, and be able to identify small changes in performance over time while also limiting potential practice effect confounds [REF].
1.4.1.1.2	Injury
As discussed in earlier chapters, the broad and complex topography of episodic memory’s neural architecture means that encoding, consolidation, and recall ability can be impaired due to brain injury in any of a wide range of cortical regions [REF]. As with the issues discussed in relation to dementia, episodic memory tests must also be able to identify specific deficits in episodic memory, such as in encoding, recall, or domain-based impairments such as spatial memory. Similarly, if any results from an episodic memory assessment are to be used in rehabilitation management, the reliability and validity of these results is paramount for making patient specific rehabilitation decisions.
1.4.1.2	Research
Behind the interventions and rehabilitation processes used in clinical settings, it is the domain of neuroscientific research that determines the procedure and parameters of such interventions. This begins at the level of the theoretical, conceptualising what is happening on a neurological and cognitive level when encoding, storing, and recalling episodic memories. As stated in the beginning of this chapter, it is measurement that separates philosophy from science, and the accuracy and validity of these measurements are what allows researchers to determine theory, make predictions, conduct experiments, and subsequently refine theory. Without such tools being available to researchers, the field of episodic memory research risks being undermined by inaccurate or misleading data and therefore resulting in sub-optimal intervention parameters [REF].
1.4.2	History of EM Measurement
Ebbinghaus – Nonsense syllables and the forgetting curve:
Hermann Ebbinghaus was the first to approach memory as a quantifiable construct by removing prior knowledge as a confounding variable [REF]. His motivation was to isolate memory itself, which led him to develop lists of nonsense syllables and measure how long it took to relearn them after a delay. This method revealed the now-famous forgetting curve, which shows how memory declines rapidly over time before plateauing. Although this approach allowed for tight experimental control, it lacked ecological validity, as nonsense syllables do not resemble real-world memories. Nevertheless, Ebbinghaus’ work laid the foundation for empirical memory research by showing that memory performance can be systematically and reliably measured, albeit with limitations in face validity.
Bartlett – Narrative recall and memory distortions:
Frederic Bartlett introduced a more naturalistic approach by asking participants to recall complex stories, such as the famous “War of the Ghosts” narrative [REF]. He was motivated by a desire to understand how personal schemas shape recollection. Bartlett's method demonstrated that memory is reconstructive, with participants unconsciously altering unfamiliar or culturally incongruent elements of the story. His findings challenged the notion of memory as a passive recording device and instead highlighted its malleability. While this method greatly improved ecological validity, it also introduced subjective variability between participants that made precise measurement more difficult. Nonetheless, Bartlett’s work was pivotal in shifting the field toward understanding memory as an active, interpretive process.
Tulving – Cue-recall and remembering vs knowing:
Endel Tulving’s research introduced critical distinctions within episodic memory itself. Using cue-recall paradigms, he showed that people sometimes recognize a stimulus without recalling the original episode, a process he termed “knowing”, while other times individuals can vividly recollect contextual details he termed “remembering” [REF]. His motivation was to separate different cognitive processes underlying recognition and recollection. Tulving’s paradigm allowed researchers to parse out these processes experimentally, laying the groundwork for dual-process theories of memory. However, the subjective nature of the “remember/know” distinction limits its objectivity. Even so, his work remains foundational in how researchers conceptualize and measure the richness of episodic recall.
Brewer – Diary studies and the importance of context:
William Brewer took an idiographic approach, using diary studies to track participants’ memories of daily life [REF]. His motivation was to better understand how episodic memories are formed in natural contexts. Participants recorded events as they happened and were later tested on their recall. This method revealed the strong influence of contextual cues, such as time, place, and emotional state, on episodic retrieval. Brewer’s work highlighted the ecological and individual variability in memory formation, although diary methods are labour-intensive and not easily scalable. Still, the findings emphasized the role of personal context in episodic recall and shaped later models of memory encoding and retrieval.
Lockhart & Craik – Word lists and encoding depth:
Fergus Craik and Robert Lockhart proposed the levels-of-processing framework, asserting that the depth of encoding, rather than rehearsal or repetition, determines memory retention. Using word list experiments, they manipulated how deeply participants processed each word (e.g., shallow visual features vs. deep semantic meaning) before testing recall [REF]. The results demonstrated that deeper processing led to significantly better memory performance. Their work shifted the field away from simplistic models of memory capacity toward more cognitively nuanced explanations of encoding. While their model struggled to define “depth” in objective terms, it introduced experimental methods for systematically examining encoding processes and their effects on episodic memory.
Squire – Clinical case studies and the hippocampus:
Larry Squire used clinical case studies, particularly of patients with brain injuries, to investigate the neural basis of episodic memory [REF]. Motivated by questions about which brain structures support memory, his work with amnesic patients (notably those with hippocampal damage) showed that episodic memory could be selectively impaired while other types of memory remained relatively intact (see chapter 1.3). These findings provided compelling evidence for the hippocampus as a critical structure for episodic encoding and retrieval. However, case study methods, while rich in detail, lack generalisability. Nonetheless, Squire’s work was instrumental in establishing early biological underpinnings of episodic memory and linking cognitive theories to neural systems.
Moscovitch – Autobiographical interview and EM vs SM distinction:
Morris Moscovitch contributed to the field by refining how autobiographical memories are assessed. He developed structured interviews that prompted participants to recount detailed personal events, with particular focus on the vividness, specificity, and contextual richness of each memory [REF]. His motivation was to distinguish episodic memory (rich in perceptual detail and context) from semantic memory (general facts about the world). The resulting data showed that these memory systems could be functionally and neurologically dissociated. While reliant on subjective reporting, Moscovitch’s method provided a valuable framework for systematically comparing different types of memory and has since been widely adopted in both clinical and research settings.
Schacter – Episodic simulation and the seven sins of memory:
Daniel Schacter’s work expanded the domain of episodic memory beyond past recollection to include future thinking and imagination. He introduced the concept of “episodic simulation,” where the brain uses similar mechanisms to recall the past and simulate the future [REF]. Through behavioural experiments and neuroimaging, he demonstrated that the constructive nature of episodic memory is both adaptive and prone to systematic errors, summarized in his “seven sins of memory”. His work emphasized the functional utility of memory errors and positioned episodic memory as a dynamic, future-oriented system, helping build the foundation for the functional definition of episodic memory. Though difficult to quantify, Schacter’s insights deeply influenced theoretical frameworks and underscored the broader cognitive significance of episodic memory.
1.4.3	Current Methods
Modern tools for measuring episodic memory vary widely in format, ranging from structured recall tests to real-world autobiographical methods. Each of these tools targets a slightly different facet of episodic memory, verbal, visual, spatial, autobiographical, or contextual, and each comes with its own advantages and limitations when it comes to assessing memory accuracy, ecological validity, and sensitivity to subtle impairment or longitudinal changes in performance [REF]. Furthermore, many existing tests fail to address all core components of episodic memory as defined by Tulving: the integration of "what," "where," and "when" information, as well as autonoetic consciousness, a form of self-aware mental time travel. This section critically reviews current methods, highlighting their practical applications and theoretical alignment with episodic memory.
1.4.3.1	Verbal
1.4.3.1.1	Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT)  
These list-learning tasks were developed to evaluate verbal episodic memory through immediate recall, delayed recall, and recognition of word lists. André Rey developed the RAVLT in the 1940s (30 years before episodic memory entered scientific nomenclature), and subsequent variants like the CVLT and HVLT expanded its utility by introducing semantic clustering and distractor lists [REF]. These tools are commonly used in clinical settings to assess memory impairments related to conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and traumatic brain injury. Their main strength lies in their standardization and ease of administration. However, the use of unrelated or semi-related word lists raises questions about ecological validity. I.e., recalling lists of nouns is a far cry from how episodic memory is engaged in real-world settings [REF]. Furthermore, these tests often assess memory over short intervals, potentially overlooking the known impacts that consolidation and reconstructive retrieval processes have on episodic memories over longer timescales.
1.4.3.1.2	Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS)  
Originally developed by David Wechsler, the Wechsler Memory Scale is a comprehensive battery that includes subtests targeting both verbal and visual episodic memory [REF]. These include logical memory, verbal paired associates, and story recall. The WMS is widely used in neuropsychological assessments due to its breadth and standardization. However, while the test provides a useful summary score of memory functioning, its episodic components often focus on short delays and structured stimuli as opposed to the storage and retrieval of rich multi-sensory information over the course of days and weeks. As a result, the WMS may fail to capture the richness and contextual dependency of everyday episodic memories, and its reliance on narrative and sentence structure may disadvantage individuals with language or cultural differences.
1.4.3.2	Visual
1.4.3.2.1	Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test  
Developed by André Rey and later standardized by Paul-Alexandre Osterrieth, this task requires participants to reproduce a complex geometric figure immediately and after a delay [REF]. It is designed to assess visuospatial memory and organizational strategies. It is particularly useful in detecting right-hemisphere or visual processing deficits and is often employed in clinical neuropsychology. While it offers insights into visual encoding and memory structure, the task lacks episodic content per se. It evaluates memory for abstract spatial arrangements, not events or contexts tied to specific experiences. Consequently, it may only partially reflect real-world episodic memory.
1.4.3.2.2	Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT)  
The BVMT, created by Ralph Benedict, offers a more structured and repeatable alternative to the complex figure task. Participants view a grid of geometric shapes and then reproduce them from memory across multiple trials [REF]. This method is efficient and has strong psychometric properties for assessing visual episodic memory. However, like the Rey-Osterrieth test, it abstracts memory from meaningful or autobiographical content, limiting its ability to measure episodic recall as experienced in naturalistic settings. Like most episodic memory metrics, the BVMT relies on a short delay between encoding and recall, limiting insights into how these memories change over longer timescales.
1.4.3.3	Spatial
1.4.3.3.1	Corsi Block Tapping Task  
The Corsi Blocks, developed by Philip Michael Corsi, involve recalling sequences of block locations tapped by the examiner. Though traditionally considered a measure of spatial working memory, variations have adapted the paradigm to assess spatial episodic memory with delays and novel sequences [REF]. It is widely used in both clinical and experimental research for spatial memory profiling. However, it is limited in its episodic validity: it does not involve contextual binding or personal experience, making it better suited to working memory than episodic recall.
1.4.3.3.2	Four Mountains Test  
Developed by Hugo Spiers and colleagues, the Four Mountains Test assesses allocentric spatial memory. Participants are shown a mountain scene and must later identify it from different viewpoints [REF]. It is particularly sensitive to hippocampal damage and has been proposed as an early marker of Alzheimer’s disease. This task comes closer to capturing the spatial navigation component of episodic memory and is grounded in the role of the hippocampus in spatial encoding. However, it isolates spatial detail from narrative or emotional content, limiting its scope in assessing episodic memory as a multidimensional construct.
1.4.3.4	Autobiographical
1.4.3.4.1	Autobiographical Memory Interview (AMI)  
Developed by Kopelman, Wilson, and Baddeley, the AMI is a structured interview designed to assess both personal semantic memory and episodic recall of specific life events [REF]. It is commonly used in clinical neuropsychology to evaluate retrograde amnesia or autobiographical memory loss. Its strength lies in its ability to probe real-life, personally meaningful memories. However, scoring is subjective, and responses are difficult to standardise across individuals, making quantitative comparisons challenging. Furthermore, due to repeated retrieval and reconsolidation, autobiographical memories often become semanticised or altered, which may limit the test’s capacity to accurately reflect episodic memory.
1.4.3.4.2	Autobiographical Memory Task (AMT)  
The AMT asks participants to generate specific memories in response to emotional cue words, assessing the specificity and emotional content of episodic recall [REF]. It is widely used in affective disorders and PTSD research to examine over general memory patterns. The task taps into self-relevant memory and emotional salience, central to episodic recall. However, responses are subjective and rely on verbal report, which can be problematic for populations with communication deficits or those who struggle to articulate past experiences. Additionally, the accuracy of the recalled content cannot be externally verified.
1.4.3.5	Recognition
1.4.3.5.1	Famous Faces Test  
This task assesses recognition memory for well-known individuals, requiring participants to name or identify famous people from photographs [REF]. It is typically used to test semantic memory but has been adapted to assess recognition of personally relevant or recently encoded faces. While easy to administer and score, the task is heavily influenced by cultural exposure, age, and media familiarity, limiting its objectivity. Furthermore, face recognition taps into both semantic and episodic components, making it a somewhat ambiguous measure unless carefully controlled.
1.4.3.5.2	Continuous Recognition Task  
In this paradigm, developed by Shepard and colleagues, participants are shown a stream of stimuli and must identify repeated items after varying delays [REF]. It allows for fine-grained measurement of recognition accuracy and response time. Continuous recognition tasks are especially useful in experimental contexts due to their scalability and tight control of stimulus exposure. However, because stimuli are often artificial and devoid of context, the paradigm may fail to capture the richer associative and contextual elements of true episodic memory.
1.4.3.6	Paired Associates
1.4.3.6.1	Memory for Object and Context Task  
This task requires participants to remember which object appeared in which context (e.g., a hammer in a kitchen vs. a hammer in a garage) [REF]. It is designed to assess binding processes crucial to episodic memory. This task is especially sensitive to medial temporal lobe function and is useful in experimental paradigms. However, it relies on artificial encoding of context and object pairs, which may not reflect naturalistic memory processes.
1.4.3.6.2	Face-Name Association Task
Participants are asked to remember the name associated with a presented face [REF]. This task is commonly used in aging and dementia research, as face-name binding is notably challenging for older adults. It targets associative memory and has high ecological validity for daily life scenarios like social interactions. However, performance can be influenced by familiarity biases or prior experience, and cultural differences in naming conventions may affect results.
1.4.3.6.3	Scene Construction Task  
Originally developed to examine imagination and future thinking, the Scene Construction Task asks participants to mentally construct and describe detailed, novel scenes [REF]. While it does not directly measure recall, it has been shown to rely heavily on the same hippocampal networks as episodic memory. It provides a unique window into the generative aspects of memory but is difficult to score objectively and depends heavily on verbal ability. Nonetheless, it underscores the constructive and imaginative facets of episodic cognition.
1.4.3.6.4	What-When-Where Paradigm
The What-When-Where (WWW) paradigm is designed to align closely with Tulving’s definition of episodic memory as the integration of temporally dated information and spatial-temporal relationships. Originating from Clayton and Dickinson’s (1998) studies on scrub jays, the paradigm has been adapted for human research using experimental tasks that ask participants to recall specific elements of an episode, what occurred, where it happened, and when it happened. Studies such as Holland and Smulders (2011) demonstrated that human participants are capable of recalling WWW elements with significant accuracy and report mental time travel in the process. The WWW paradigm provides a valuable behavioural proxy for episodic memory and is particularly sensitive to deficits in relational and contextual memory. However, the ‘when’ component can be problematic if it only captures elapsed time rather than event order, which is more indicative of chronesthesia. Despite this, the WWW test remains one of the most theoretically aligned measures of episodic memory currently available.
1.4.3.7	Modern Computerized and VR-Based Methods
1.4.3.7.1	Computerized Cognitive Batteries (e.g., CANTAB, Cogstate)  
These platforms provide standardized, often touchscreen-based assessments of memory and cognition, including episodic memory tasks such as pattern recognition and paired associate learning [REF]. Their automated scoring and broad accessibility make them useful for large-scale clinical trials and research studies. However, they often abstract memory from naturalistic settings and may disadvantage those unfamiliar with technology.
1.4.3.7.2	Face-Scene or Face-Place Associative Tasks  
Often used in fMRI and hippocampal research, these tasks assess the ability to form and retrieve associations between faces and spatial contexts [REF]. They are particularly sensitive to relational memory deficits and are useful in early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. However, the artificial nature of the stimuli may reduce ecological validity.
1.4.3.7.3	Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)  
EMA methods use mobile devices to probe memory for real-life events throughout the day, capturing fluctuations in episodic memory performance in natural contexts [REF]. While offering high ecological validity and sensitivity to subtle changes, these methods are logistically demanding and depend on consistent participant compliance.
1.4.3.7.4	Scene Memory and Real-World Photographic Tasks  
Participants are asked to recall or recognize specific details from photos or videos of everyday scenes [REF]. These tasks aim to capture the contextual richness of episodic memory and are particularly useful in aging and trauma-related research. However, standardization can be difficult, and cultural relevance must be considered. Furthermore, this method’s encoding procedure does not adequately approximate the contextual role of egocentric time and place information. In other words, looking at a photo or watching a video does not engage time and place cells in the hippocampal network in a way that would represent the individual actually being present in the scene.
1.4.3.7.5	Virtual Reality (VR)-Based Memory Tasks  
VR-based paradigms represent a growing frontier in episodic memory research. These tasks immerse participants in lifelike environments where they perform goal-directed actions (e.g., navigating rooms, interacting with objects) before being tested on their memory for those experiences. VR methods offer unparalleled ecological validity and are particularly promising for detecting subtle memory impairments and evaluating rehabilitation outcomes [REF]. Critically, VR enables precise control over stimulus presentation, replicates real-world encoding conditions, and allows researchers to objectively verify recall accuracy across the What-Where-When dimensions [REF]. Furthermore, VR can simulate incidental encoding without alerting participants to upcoming memory tests, better mimicking how episodic memories form in daily life [REF]. While challenges include equipment costs, motion sensitivity, and limited standardization, the potential for VR to measure autonoetic consciousness and mental time travel more robustly than traditional methods makes it an especially compelling tool for ongoing episodic memory research.
1.4.4	Conclusion
Methods for measuring episodic memory have evolved considerably, from Ebbinghaus’ strictly controlled nonsense syllables to contemporary virtual reality paradigms that aim to capture the who, what, where, and when of everyday experiences. Each of the tools discussed shares a basic commonality: information is encoded, a delay is imposed, and subsequent recall or recognition accuracy is measured. Despite this uniform structural theme, all instruments exhibit inherent limitations. Some, like list-learning tasks, sacrifice ecological validity for experimental control. Others, such as autobiographical interviews, excel in authenticity yet struggle with standardization and objective verification. Furthermore, many tests only indirectly address the autonoetic and context-rich nature of true episodic recall.
These methodological challenges underscore why researchers continue to seek out new ways of measuring episodic memory, building and testing approaches that balance realism, control, and the capacity to capture both the detailed content and the subjective, reconstructive quality of remembering. Technological advances, particularly in virtual reality, provide an opportunity to bridge these gaps. By immersing participants in controlled, yet lifelike scenarios, VR-based measures can elicit incidental encoding, test multi-sensory integration, and assess the what-where-when components in real time, while also allowing for participants to evaluate their confidence in their recollections. As next-generation tools refine our ability to observe and quantify episodic phenomena, the field of episodic memory research moves closer to capturing the adaptive, future-oriented, and deeply personal essence of how we remember.
1.5	THE PROBLEMS WITH MEASURING EPISODIC MEMORY
As discussed in chapter 1.4, measuring episodic memory performance using established pen-and-paper methods presents inherent flaws at each stage of the memory process. Although these methods have provided critical insights into memory function and remain useful in both clinical and research settings, they often prioritise simplicity, standardisation, and accessibility over ecological and theoretical precision. While the utility of these priorities cannot be understated, it is generally accepted that most standard tests do not adequately employ real world experiences as stimuli while also producing appropriately standardised results [REF]. This section outlines several key measurement limitations across the three core stages of episodic memory’s encoding, consolidation, and recall, as well as broader conceptual challenges to measuring episodic memory as it naturally occurs in the real world.
1.5.1	Encoding
Episodic memory in everyday life is formed through multisensory, spatially embedded, and goal-directed experiences. People move through physical environments, interact with objects, and encode memories in the presence of rich sensory and spatial cues. This type of encoding relies heavily on self-initiated movement, egocentric perspective shifts, and the integration of visual, auditory, and proprioceptive information. These elements are essential for forming cognitive maps and binding memories to a specific time and place, all of which have been identified as critical informational cues for subsequent episodic recall.
In contrast, standard memory assessments often rely on static and decontextualised stimuli, such as word lists or abstract images, presented in controlled laboratory or clinical environments. While this approach enhances standardisation and scoring reliability, it fails to replicate the conditions under which episodic memory naturally forms. As a result, such tests may underestimate the role of spatial and semantic context in memory encoding and are less sensitive to the complex dynamics of real-world memory formation [REF].
1.5.2	Consolidation and Delay
The process of memory consolidation refers to the stabilisation and transformation of newly encoded information into long-term memory stores. This process unfolds over extended timeframes, typically hours, days, or even weeks, and can be influenced by many factors, including sleep quality, interference from other memories, and emotional salience [REF].
Many traditional EM tasks, however, only include brief delays (e.g., 20 to 30 minutes) between encoding and recall. While this allows for practical administration, it does not provide a reliable measure of long-term memory retention. Moreover, the consolidation process is often dynamic, with some memories weakening over time while others strengthen or become integrated into broader autobiographical memory networks. According to models such as Conway’s Self-Memory System, only a small fraction of episodic memories are retained unless they are incorporated into one’s autobiographical framework. Standard testing paradigms rarely account for this selective retention, resulting in a limited understanding of memory persistence across realistic timescales.
1.5.3	Recall
The act of recalling an episodic memory involves reconstructing a scene or event using information across multiple domains, including spatial layout, temporal sequencing, semantic meaning, cognitive maps, and sensory detail. In real-world recall, these elements are interwoven. However, standardised tests often isolate a single modality, such as verbal recall or visual reproduction, which may not capture the richness or interdependence of natural episodic recall.
In addition, recall performance is affected by stable traits (such as age or cognitive capacity) as well as transient states (such as sleep, stress, or mood). Most traditional memory tests measure performance at a single time point, making it difficult to separate these influences. This limits their utility in tracking changes in memory function over time or in understanding the effects of situational variables on recall ability [REF].
While autobiographical memory tests attempt to capture real-life recall by using personal experiences, they face challenges in standardisation. Different individuals will recall different types of events with varying levels of detail, emotional salience, and personal significance. This variability, while ecologically valid, complicates efforts to compare performance across individuals, populations, and cultures.
Another complication is the subjectivity of vividness and confidence. People often report greater confidence in emotional or dramatic memories, yet these memories are not necessarily more accurate. Research on flashbulb memories, for example, shows that even highly vivid and confidently reported memories may be prone to distortions, particularly as time passes [REF].
1.5.4	Conceptual and Theoretical Ambiguity
Definitional ambiguity presents an ongoing challenge for episodic memory research. Tulving originally defined episodic memory as the recollection of specific events situated in time and space and characterised by autonoetic consciousness, a form of self-aware mental time travel. However, this definition has generated debate, especially concerning how it applies across populations and tasks [REF].
For instance, some patients with semantic dementia, who show pronounced deficits in general world knowledge, have demonstrated intact recall of specific episodic events [REF]. This challenges the assumption that semantic knowledge is a prerequisite for episodic memory, or conversely, suggests that some tasks labelled as “episodic” may not meet the full theoretical criteria.
The boundary between episodic and semantic memory is also fluid over time. Several studies have demonstrated a shift from “remember” responses to “know” responses as memories age [REF]. This shift reflects the semanticisation of episodic memories, whereby specific perceptual and temporal details are lost and only the general meaning remains. This makes it difficult to determine at what point a memory ceases to be episodic.
Furthermore, the reliance on subjective self-report, for example, asking participants to judge whether they “remember” or “know” a stimulus, adds a layer of interpretive uncertainty. While self-report is valuable, it is inherently susceptible to individual differences in introspection, interpretation of task instructions, and personal criteria for assigning confidence.
1.5.5	Additional Challenges
Several additional issues complicate the accurate measurement of episodic memory. One such challenge is the role of contextual information. In natural settings, semantic and spatial context strongly influence what is encoded and how it is later recalled. However, standard tasks often abstract away from this context, making them less representative of real-world memory use.
Another limitation is the near absence of meta-memory assessment in many tests [REF]. Meta-memory refers to a person’s awareness of their own memory processes, including how confident they are in their recall. This aspect of cognition plays an important role in decision making, learning strategies, and day-to-day functioning but is rarely incorporated into standard EM assessments.
Memory distortion is also a significant concern, particularly for open-ended or autobiographical tasks. Individuals may recall only the general “gist” of an event, or they may experience intrusion errors, where false details are unconsciously inserted into the memory. These distortions are often indistinguishable from genuine recollection in both structure and confidence, complicating the evaluation of memory accuracy, and very difficult for researchers to determine truth from fiction [REF].
1.5.6	Conclusion
In summary, while traditional pen-and-paper methods have advanced our understanding of memory and remain widely used, they face fundamental limitations in capturing the full complexity of episodic memory. These limitations include reduced ecological validity, narrow temporal sampling, reliance on isolated domains, susceptibility to memory distortion, and theoretical ambiguity regarding the nature of episodic recall itself.
Addressing these issues will require new approaches that can accommodate the richness of real-world memory experiences, track memory over meaningful intervals, and disentangle trait-level ability from state-dependent variability. A growing interest in naturalistic and immersive methods reflects this need and opens the door for more ecologically grounded and theoretically robust tools for measuring episodic memory.
1.6	VIRTUAL REALITY
Virtual reality (VR) encompasses a diverse array of technologies capable of creating interactive, three-dimensional environments that simulate real or imagined worlds. The term has been used broadly across disciplines, from entertainment and training to cognitive neuroscience and psychology [REF]. In memory research, particularly concerning episodic memory, VR's primary advantage lies in its capacity to present dynamic and contextually rich scenarios under highly controlled laboratory conditions. The duality of improved ecological validity and experimental precision makes VR uniquely suited to investigate the complexities of traditionally difficult to measure cognitive behaviours, such as episodic memory. This chapter will introduce key concepts in VR for memory research, describe the three types of VR used in cognitive neuroscience research, and show how VR has been used in the past to understand memory.
1.6.1	Key Concepts
1.6.1.1	Immersion
Immersion refers to the fidelity of the VR system in replicating real-world sensory and motor experiences. High levels of immersion allow participants to encode events as they would in everyday life, through head movements, body navigation, and multimodal sensory input. This alignment with natural encoding mechanisms is critical for the study of episodic memory, which relies on the integration of spatial, temporal, and perceptual information.
1.6.1.2	Presence
Presence is the subjective experience of being in a place, even when one is physically located elsewhere. High presence in VR is associated with increased attentional engagement and deeper cognitive processing. Studies have found a strong correlation between experienced presence and memory performance, suggesting that this psychological immersion enhances the formation and retrieval of episodic memories.
1.6.2	Types of VR
VR technologies differ significantly in their levels of immersion, interactivity, and ecological realism. Researchers typically distinguish between desktop VR, simulator VR, and immersive VR (iVR), each with distinct characteristics and suitability for cognitive research.
1.6.2.1	Desktop VR
Desktop VR, as the name suggests, presents virtual environments on a standard desktop computer screen and users interact with these environments using conventional input devices such as a mouse and keyboard. This type of VR has been used extensively in research since the 1980s due to its affordability and ease of use. Participants typically navigate virtual spaces by pressing directional keys or clicking on-screen elements, which reduces the complexity of the task and simplifies experimental design.
However, desktop VR suffers from key limitations in terms of immersion and ecological validity. The two-dimensional nature of screen-based presentation provides only monocular depth cues, limiting spatial perception. Essentially, an individual’s episodic memory of desktop VR stimuli would be a recollection of themselves watching content on a screen, as opposed to a recollection of themselves immersed in a particular scene or environment. Additionally, motor engagement is minimal, turning one’s viewpoint or walking forward requires moving a mouse or pressing a key, not the naturalistic sensorimotor behaviours that occur in real environments. This reduction in bodily involvement means typical episodic encoding mechanisms are not engaged, such as forming cognitive maps or engaging place cells in the hippocampal network. This means studying episodic memory via desktop VR based tasks results in significantly compromised ecological validity as key environmental cues are missing during the encoding process.
1.6.2.2	Simulator VR
Simulator VR employs visual projections that surround the participant on multiple walls or screens. These setups can support stereoscopic vision and often include specialised equipment such as head tracking and motion-sensitive controls. Simulator VR increases the level of immersion compared to desktop VR by enabling participants to feel more physically present within the environment, however naturalistic bodily exploration within a simulator virtual environment is typically not possible. Despite its advantages over desktop VR, simulator VR is resource-intensive and requires dedicated physical spaces and expensive hardware. It is less accessible for most research groups and lacks the scalability required for broader implementation. Simulator VR is still very appropriate for tasks where a participant is seated, such as driving or flight simulators. However, simulator VR’s limitations in naturalistic exploration and interaction led to the development and increased adoption of a more flexible and affordable alternative, immersive VR.
1.6.2.3	Immersive VR
Immersive VR (iVR) employs head-mounted displays that provide stereoscopic visual input directly to the user's eyes and allow for real-time updates based on head and body movement. Participants can naturally look around, move through, and interact with the environment, often using tracked handheld controllers or cameras that capture hand movements to recreate a user’s hand movements in the virtual environment. This creates a highly immersive experience where perception and action are closely aligned with real-world interactions.
For the purposes of this thesis, iVR refers specifically to VR systems that employ head-mounted displays and support embodied exploration of three-dimensional spaces. Compared to desktop VR and simulator VR, iVR provides the most naturalistic and ecologically valid conditions for encoding and recalling experiences. It is this form of VR that offers the greatest potential for advancing the measurement of episodic memory.
1.6.3	Examples of Memory Research Using iVR
1.6.3.1	Everyday Memory
Virtual supermarkets, homes, and office environments have been employed extensively to examine memory for routine activities such as shopping, object placement, and task planning. These paradigms closely replicate everyday experiences, thereby enhancing ecological validity and enabling more accurate assessments of episodic memory performance within familiar contexts. For instance, studies using virtual shopping tasks demonstrated a correlation between performance in these realistic scenarios and real-world memory functioning, suggesting VR's potential in ecological assessments of everyday memory (Frost et al., 2019).
1.6.3.2	Spatial Memory
VR's ability to provide large-scale and realistic environments has significantly impacted spatial memory research. Traditional tabletop spatial memory tests typically fail to reflect the complexity of real-life navigation, as all necessary information is within the participant's immediate field of view. In contrast, VR enables navigation in environments where most information is initially hidden, similar to real-world conditions. For example, the virtual Morris water maze (Hamilton & Sutherland, 1999) and radial arm maze (Leplow et al., 1998), adapted from rodent studies, have been successfully applied to human participants using VR.

Early VR studies, such as Maguire et al. (1998), required participants to navigate a complex virtual town, demonstrating that cognitive maps formed during virtual exploration are comparable to those developed in real environments (Ruddle et al., 1997). Subsequent studies confirmed that spatial knowledge acquired virtually transfers effectively to real-world navigation tasks (Arthur et al., 1997; Waller et al., 1998; Wesley Regian & Yadrick, 1994; Witmer et al., 1996). Such research highlights VR's strong ecological validity in spatial memory assessment and underscores the critical role of immersion and presence—factors positively correlated with enhanced memory performance (Schomaker, Roos, & Meeter, 2014; Witmer & Singer, 1998).
1.6.3.3	Working Memory
Working memory studies utilizing iVR, such as those conducted by Mousavi (2018), demonstrate how immersive environments enable individuals to encode richer contextual details, thereby revealing differences in working memory performance compared to conventional screen-based tasks. The embodied interaction supported by iVR enhances the depth of encoding and memory trace formation, aligning working memory assessment more closely with real-world cognitive demands.
1.6.3.4	Procedural Memory
Procedural learning, the acquisition of motor skills and sequences, has been effectively explored within iVR environments. Howard (2017) showed that environmental realism and naturalistic controls significantly improve procedural task performance and skill retention. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of how VR can simulate motor learning processes beyond traditional declarative memory paradigms, emphasizing its utility in training and rehabilitation contexts.
1.6.4	iVR in Episodic Memory Research
Episodic memory inherently integrates spatial, temporal, and contextual details. Consequently, VR's spatial capabilities and immersive qualities offer unique methodological strengths for its investigation. Initial VR-based episodic memory research adapted spatial navigation paradigms from earlier spatial memory studies. For example, Burgess, Maguire, Spiers, and O’Keefe (2001) used a virtual town where participants encountered distinct objects from virtual characters at specific locations, assessing recall of object identity, location, and source. Their findings indicated that lifelike events experienced in VR elicited neural activation patterns not observed in traditional laboratory memory tasks, highlighting the greater ecological validity of VR-based methods.
Early episodic memory research typically involved abstract verbal or visual materials, such as word lists or complex figures, limiting their ecological relevance (Meyers & Meyers, 1995; Wechsler, 2008). In contrast, VR studies provide complex, realistic scenarios that resemble everyday memory challenges. This approach enables robust testing of the episodic memory triad—what, where, and when—in environments that closely mimic daily experiences (Tulving, 2002).
However, earlier episodic VR studies primarily used desktop VR, presenting virtual environments on standard computer screens. While desktop VR improved upon traditional tasks by incorporating realistic spatial contexts, it still lacked full immersion, thereby compromising ecological validity (Kinugawa et al., 2013; Zlomuzica et al., 2016). More recent shifts towards head-mounted display VR (HMD-VR) have significantly addressed these limitations. Studies increasingly demonstrate HMD-VR's superior ecological validity and predictive power regarding cognitive decline compared to traditional clinical assessments (Corriveau-Lecavalier et al., 2018; Davison et al., 2018; Ouellet et al., 2018; Parsons & McMahan, 2017).
Recent research underscores that immersive encoding experiences facilitated by HMD-VR yield higher fidelity episodic memories compared to non-immersive approaches (Nastajus, 2021; Plancher et al., 2010, 2012, 2013, 2017, 2018). This body of evidence strongly supports HMD-VR as the optimal VR method for episodic memory assessment, effectively balancing ecological realism with rigorous experimental control.
Overall, the trajectory of VR research in episodic memory indicates substantial potential for transforming cognitive assessment methodologies, offering realistic, scalable, and highly sensitive tools for understanding memory performance across populations.
1.6.5	Conclusion
Immersive VR technologies offer significant advantages for episodic memory research, effectively addressing historical limitations associated with ecological validity, and standardisation. By enabling participants to experience tightly controlled, complex, dynamic, and contextually rich environments that closely resemble everyday life, iVR can facilitate more accurate and comprehensive assessments of memory processes. The enhanced sense of immersion and presence afforded by iVR correlates strongly with improved memory encoding and recall, underscoring its potential to revolutionize cognitive neuroscience research methodologies.
The adoption of iVR addresses critical gaps left by earlier desktop and simulator VR methods, providing a powerful platform for understanding memory across diverse populations and settings. Furthermore, VR’s versatility across various memory domains, including spatial, working, procedural, and everyday memory, highlights its broad applicability and methodological robustness.
A more in-depth exploration of key technical and methodological considerations related to iVR will be provided in Chapter 2, where the development of the REMEMVR system, a bespoke iVR paradigm specifically designed to investigate episodic memory, will be discussed in detail. This subsequent chapter will address critical aspects such as environment design, task complexity, participant interaction dynamics, and technological considerations crucial for maximising ecological validity and research efficacy.
