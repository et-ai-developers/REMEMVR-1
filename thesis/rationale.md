3	RATIONALE- THE DESIGN AND BUILD OF REMEMVR
This chapter presents granular explanations of how and why I designed the experiment as presented in the previous chapter. It is intended to convey that no design choices were made arbitrarily, and maximum effort was made to choose prudent and diligently researched parameters that could be implemented within the practical, technical, and time-bound constraints of myself being the sole developer.
3.1	IDENTIFYING THE NEED FOR A NEW METRIC
The development of the Ronayne Ecological Metric for Episodic Memory using Virtual Reality (REMEMVR) was driven by a clear and persistent problem in the field of episodic memory research: how to measure an individual’s episodic memory ability with both adequate validity and rigid experimental control. Appropriately balancing these two concepts is essential for any psychological metric. Validity is critical to ensure the results are a measure of actual episodic memory behaviour, and experimental control is necessary for making direct comparisons between individual participants. However, existing methods for measuring episodic memory typically achieve one, but not both requirements.
As discussed in Chapter 1.4, episodic memory is typically assessed via two methods, by asking participants to recall details either from stimuli provided by the assessor or recall details from the participants’ own personal lived experiences. Tools that provide the participant with stimuli, such as the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Logical Memory, and Paired Associates tasks are widely used due to their exceptionally strict experimental control, reliability, and ease of administration (see 1.4.3). However, these tests often rely on abstracted stimuli (e.g., lists of unrelated words (RAVLT), or nonsensical figures (BVMT-R)) and focus on single modalities (often entirely auditory or visual). While these tests continue to provide researchers and clinicians with valuable insights into a person’s ability to recall past information, they fail to recreate the rich complexity of naturalistic experience during encoding that is fundamental to episodic memory, thus significantly compromising validity.
These tasks are often described in literature as measures of episodic memory; however, they can be more accurately described as measures of specific cognitive components within the larger framework of episodic memory. For example, measuring verbal/visual working memory or semantic fluency rather than capturing episodic behaviour as a whole. While episodic memory is indeed a product of these and other individually measurable domains, complex cuing interactions occur between these domains during episodic reconstruction, meaning overall episodic memory ability is more than the sum of its parts but also a product of how these parts interact (see 1.3.2). For example, one could consider asking a participant to recall items they purchased from a supermarket as a fundamentally semantic task, yet recollection can be enhanced with cues and constraints from their spatial memory of the supermarket layout, visual memory of what items looked like, affective memory from how the item made them feel, and temporal memory of which items they picked up first or last. In this example, an individual might show typical performance across all these domains when measured in isolation, but if there are deficits in mutual cuing between these domains, episodic memory ability could be impaired.
Moreover, much of the utility of episodic memory hinges on its ability to reconstruct details from events that happened days, months, or even years previously. These single-domain pen and paper tests, however, rarely probe recollection after delays greater than thirty minutes post encoding. This means they do not capture the trajectory of episodic memory retention over the lengths of time usually present in normal episodic memory behaviour. Episodic memories undergo structural reorganisation in the brain during sleep, a process called consolidation (see 1.3.2.2). Therefore, same day/hour encoding and recall tasks do not help inform research/clinical decisions about longer-term episodic memory retention. While multi-day delays with these tests have been trialled, the unfamiliar nature of abstract stimuli often results in floor effects, where participants have no recollection of the stimuli after several days, rendering the results behaviourally uninformative.
Finally, it is important to note that real-world episodic memory is incidental, i.e., one does not deliberately memorise details for subsequent memory testing in every-day experiences. When a follow-up memory test is anticipated, behaviour during encoding can change. Most typical stimuli provided episodic memory metrics instruct the participant to deliberately commit the stimuli to memory, inviting the application of memorisation strategies such as semantic chunking, or associating stimuli with a narrative. This uncontrolled behaviour can introduce confounds into the results. For example, one participant might apply a narrative to help memorise the items in the RAVLT word list, making recollection easier, and another does not, making recollection more difficult. These participants’ scores then become inappropriate to compare directly, as the participants were engaged in fundamentally different types of memory behaviour.
The second most common approach for measuring episodic memory, rather than the assessor providing material to be recalled, instead asks participants to recall details from actual past events from their personal lived experience. Tools like the Autobiographical Interview and Autobiographical Memory Test that probe these real episodic memories continue to endure as informative clinical metrics due to complete ecological validity in the encoding material/experience. They are well established probes of real lived experiences that were incidentally encoded in natural environments and contain the dynamic inter-domain relationships that are fundamental to real-world episodic memory. This approach however has two significant challenges that are, for all intents and purposes, insurmountable in this testing paradigm. First, the assessor typically has no ability to verify the accuracy of a participant’s recollections as they have no ground-truth of the event to make comparisons. This makes subtle inaccuracies in recollection virtually impossible to identify. Secondly, it requires an assumption of equal memorability of two different person’s past experiences. For example, if one participant lives by a strict daily routine, it could be argued that this repetition makes recalling these details is an easier task when compared to a second participant recalling details from a chaotic or unplanned event over the same time period. This makes it very difficult to standardise scores across participants and raises serious questions about how meaningful it is to make direct comparisons between individuals.
To address this historical forced choice between either having sufficient validity or sufficient experimental control, I developed REMEMVR to merge the strengths of both approaches using virtual reality. With VR, participants can be immersed in a virtual environment that permits naturalistic encoding behaviour, while also maintaining rigid experimental control, ensuring all participants encoded practically identical lived experiences. Furthermore, by including several unique virtual experiences in the encoding phase, I can probe episodic memory longitudinally by asking participants to recall events from different experiences with increasing delay periods. The close alignment of the encoded content with typical episodic behaviour allows delays to extend for durations typically observed in real episodic memory recall.
3.2	THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS INFORMING REMEMVR
My design of REMEMVR was informed by several prominent models of episodic memory (see 1.3.3). However, its purpose was not to explicitly confirm or falsify any single theoretical framework. Instead, it was intended as a tool for translational neuroscience, measuring episodic memory in a way that aligns with how it is experienced in daily life. The design embraces a functional/constructivist view of episodic memory. By embedding participants in interactive virtual environments that involve both free and goal-directed exploration, REMEMVR supports episodic encoding through embodied, egocentric experiences. Its testing structure, spanning both free recall and recognition allows researchers to probe the stability of relational bindings (e.g., object–location–time combinations) across time, providing empirical access to memory reconstruction processes.
While I didn’t design REMEMVR with the intention of refining theoretical frameworks, it offers a platform through which some theoretical predictions can be evaluated. For example, Scene Construction Theory proposes that hippocampal-supported episodic memory arises from the generation of coherent spatiotemporal contexts. REMEMVR allows this claim to be probed by correlating spatial memory fidelity with semantic or temporal degradation (see Empirical Chapter X). Similarly, Contextual Binding Theory predicts that errors should arise when context links are weak or mis-bound. REMEMVR's design explicitly includes such weakly bound relationships (e.g., incongruent objects) to enable their study (see Empirical Chapter X).
By prioritising ecological and face validity in both its design and implementation, REMEMVR aims to generate more authentic memory traces, formed through active exploration of three-dimensional environments, object manipulation, spatial navigation, and naturalistic event timing. These memory traces are inherently multidimensional and temporally examinable, allowing measurement of individual episodic ability, not as a list of facts, but as the complex and dynamic reconstruction of lived experiences as described by modern episodic memory literature.
As such, REMEMVR functions both as a measurement tool, capturing multi-paradigm performance over time, and as a hypothesis-generating platform. It can be used to examine how relational structures shape memory decay, whether semantic congruence buffers against forgetting, or how confidence aligns with accuracy in different retrieval paradigms. By simulating life-like events under controlled and repeatable conditions, REMEMVR opens new possibilities for evaluating the structure and function of episodic memory in ways that existing tools do not support.
3.3	ECOLOGICAL VALIDITY AND REAL-WORLD SIMULATION
Episodic memory is inherently complex, formed through rich, multisensory experiences embedded within spatial, semantic, and temporal contexts. As discussed in 2.1, efforts to measure episodic memory meaningfully must grapple with the challenge of balancing ecological realism with experimental control. This section outlines the rationale for these design choices, and discusses how ecological validity was pursued, compromised, and ultimately reframed through a focus on ecological realism.
3.3.1	Defining Ecological Realism vs. Ecological Validity
In the context of episodic memory research, ecological validity traditionally refers to how well a task captures the conditions under which episodic memories are formed, stored, and used in the real world. However, in practice, true ecological validity is often difficult to define or measure directly. For REMEMVR, the goal was not to claim absolute ecological validity, an arguably unreachable standard under experimental conditions, but to maximise ecological realism. That is: to recreate the natural conditions of everyday memory formation as closely as possible within the constraints of standardisation, safety, and technical feasibility. In this sense, ecological realism is aligned with face validity. If episodic memory in the real world arises from personally experienced, multisensory, and interactive events, then a task that simulates these properties in the encoding phase is more likely to engage the cognitive systems and processes relevant to real-world memory, making the task a reasonable neurological analogue of genuine episodic behaviour. 
For REMEMVR, this meant simulating experiences that participants could intuitively recognise as realistic and meaningful, walking through a room, looking around, manipulating objects, and experiencing spatial depth and ambient sounds, as opposed to merely sitting at a desk and memorising unidimensional abstract stimuli. However, recall itself, particularly in the format of structured test questions, remains artificial, and this trade-off is acknowledged as a necessary compromise in most empirical memory research (see 3.3.4).
3.3.2	Simulating Real-World Encoding
Several features of the REMEMVR platform were deliberately chosen to maximise the realism of the encoding experience. The use of a 1:1 real-to-virtual movement mapping allowed participants to walk naturally through an 8 × 5 metre open-plan space. Unlike many VR memory tasks that rely on joystick movement or teleportation, REMEMVR’s full-body locomotion preserved the natural correspondence between visual flow, vestibular feedback, and proprioception, which is essential for immersive presence and naturalistic orientation in space, all of which are typically incorporated into episodic memory traces (see 1.3.2.1).
To allow for participants to interact with the virtual environment, I decided to incorporate real-time hand tracking instead of physical controllers, enabling participants to pick up and place objects simply by closing and opening their fists near an item. This decision had multiple benefits. First, it eliminated the learning curve associated with button-based controllers, particularly for older or less technologically experienced participants. Second, it created a more intuitive, embodied interaction with objects, and third, it provided at least a minimal degree of sensorimotor feedback, which more closely resembles how objects are handled in real life. Although REMEMVR lacks true tactile feedback (e.g., weight, temperature, texture), this design choice was constrained by current technological limitations rather than by oversight.
Each of the four household rooms (bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, and living room) was designed with matched spatial layouts and ambient features, including lighting variations, time-of-day cues, and room-specific environmental sounds (e.g., thunderstorms in the living room, running water in the bathroom). Participants were guided through each room by a verbal script that ensured uniformity of experience across individuals. Although this scripting reduces ecological validity by removing the natural spontaneity of exploration, it was essential for standardising exposure and enabling meaningful comparisons between participants.
3.3.3	Consolidation and Delay Structure
A key element of REMEMVR’s ecological realism lies in its longitudinal design. Unlike most traditional memory tests, which assess recall minutes after encoding, I distributed REMEMVR’s memory assessments across four time points, immediately after encoding (Day 0), and then after 1, 3, and 6 days. This design was modelled on the logarithmic decay structure of Ebbinghaus' forgetting curve and was intended to capture potential differences in early and late-stage memory consolidation. Importantly, this structure allows for naturalistic sleep/wake cycles between tests, something rarely accounted for in conventional paradigms. Given the substantial evidence that sleep plays a critical role in episodic memory consolidation, REMEMVR’s repeated-measures assessment schedule allows for the examination of how episodic memories are stabilised and transformed across time in everyday life at both an individual and group level.
3.3.4	Controlled Yet Artificial Recall
While I designed REMEMVR’s encoding phase to be as naturalistic as possible, the test phase was necessarily artificial. Achieving rigid experimental control requires structured memory retrieval tasks that are identical and consistent across participants and trials. This includes fixed test sections (free recall, cued recall, and recognition), consistent question formats, and controlled foils/distractors.
This unavoidable artificiality however does not negate REMEMVR’s ecological ambitions. Rather, it reflects the inherent compromise between realism and repeatability. A key design principle was to preserve the natural encoding conditions while allowing recall to be measured in a way that supports direct statistical comparisons. In this sense, REMEMVR measures real-world-like encoding under controlled retrieval conditions, a methodological trade-off that prioritises interpretability without sacrificing ecological realism.
3.3.5	Generalisability and Cultural Considerations
Another central challenge in designing REMEMVR was ensuring that its content could be understood and interpreted consistently across participants from different cultural or linguistic backgrounds. To address this, all rooms were constructed as typical household environments with globally recognisable objects, e.g., toothbrush, hammer, book, keys, while avoiding culturally specific or unfamiliar items. Participant-specific naming of items was supported by the assessor noticing if a participant used an alternative label for an object. Those participant specific nouns were recorded and incorporated into my dynamic test generation software such that participants were examined using their own familiar vocabulary. For example, a French speaking participant might call a bathroom sink a ‘lavabo’. This was recorded and incorporated into their bathroom test so instead of asking if they placed an item near the sink, their test asked if they placed an item near the lavabo. This design choice was made to prevent participants from answering questions incorrectly due to unfamiliarity with particular nouns as opposed to genuinely having forgotten this detail. Although further work is needed to validate REMEMVR across non-Western populations, no participants in the current sample reported confusion or unfamiliarity with the core environments or items, in part due to this incorporation of custom names for test items. Future iterations may explore “room pack” modularity, allowing researchers to swap out a scene (e.g., bedroom) for one more culturally appropriate (e.g., courtyard or market) while preserving item count, complexity, and test format.
3.4	CORE DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
My final design of REMEMVR was guided by a combination of theoretical goals, practical constraints, and iterative refinement via extensive pilot testing. Prior to construction of the VR application, study website, and memory tests, I defined several key requirements. 
REMEMVR must:
1.	Encode a cohort of participants with practically identical lived experiences. 
2.	Probe episodic memory trajectories over multiple days. 
3.	Measure performance across what/when/where cognitive domains. 
4.	Test recall across both free-recall, cued-recall, and recognition paradigms. 
5.	Capture item-based confidence as an estimate of meta-memory. 
6.	Produce a highly organised and flexible dataset.
3.4.1	Standardisation and Repeatability
A major challenge in episodic memory research is achieving standardisation without sacrificing ecological realism. In the real world, different people do not have identical subjective lived experiences; however, VR makes it possible to significantly reduce the differences between individual experiences. This was achieved by instructing participants to complete tasks via a tightly curated script, ensuring that each participant completed the same tasks, in the same order, for the same duration, in the same environments. While allowing full freedom of exploration and interaction in the virtual environments would indeed increase ecological realism, this would be at the cost of standardisation between individuals, a key objective in REMEMVR.
The VR instructions were delivered identically across all participants via a tightly scripted protocol, similar to those used in clinical memory tools like the RAVLT. To reduce interpersonal variability, the two experimenters (myself and a research assistant) regularly observed each other’s sessions to ensure that delivery style, tone, and phrasing remained consistent. Repeatability was further reinforced by ensuring a fixed order of test sections, consistent stimulus formats, and a standardised item placement and room layout across participants.
3.4.2	Longitudinal Performance Tracking
One of the limitations of traditional episodic memory metrics is their lack of a multi-day longitudinal structure. To overcome this, REMEMVR participants explored four virtual household rooms (bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, and living room), and completed four memory tests, each focussed on details from a single room. These tests were given to participants immediately after encoding (Day 0), and then after 1, 3, and 6 days. These delays were selected to approximate the logarithmic nature of the forgetting curve, inspired by Ebbinghaus’ early work. By spacing tests at exponentially increasing intervals, this was anticipated to linearise the rate of forgetting and enable fine-grained modelling of memory decay trajectories. Furthermore, this longitudinal structure allows the analysis to calculate intercepts (trait memory performance), slopes (rate of forgetting), and residuals (state-level noise or fluctuations in trait ability). 
3.4.3	What / Where / When Structure
I designed REMEMVR’s memory assessments to reflect Tulving’s classical formulation of episodic memory as involving memory for “what happened, where it happened, and when it happened”. These three axes are common across many episodic memory frameworks, including Scene Construction Theory, Contextual Binding Theory, and the PMAT model (see 1.3.3). While additional dimensions such as affective valence and attention were considered, they were excluded due to the significant subjectivity inherent in affective processing, and the technical complexity of incorporating eye-tracking into the VR application. Rather than operationalise affect and attention, stimuli were selected such that no significant emotional response was anticipated, and participants were asked to describe items and observations to ensure they were actively attending to the stimuli.
3.4.4	Multi-Paradigm Retrieval Design
REMEMVR’s test design includes free recall, cued recall, and recognition tests for each room. While free recall and recognition are common in memory research, a middle-ground “cued recall” paradigm was developed to simulate partial memory reactivation and explore any effect potential inter-domain cuing may have on reconstruction. Free-recall questions were asked first and offered no ancillary information about the correct response. (e.g., “Name an item you picked up in the bathroom”). Cued-recall questions included a general schematic of the room’s layout and asked participants to select correct answers in a multi-choice format with semantically related foils (e.g., “Which of the following items did you pick up in the bathroom? Book, Magazine, Newspaper…” with labelled map locations to for spatial questions). While this is not a textbook implementation of cued recall, it functionally probes how minimal environmental scaffolding might support retrieval, offering a window into the reconstructive nature of episodic memory.
Each recall paradigm taps different underlying neural and cognitive processes, and prior research shows that these vary across age and ability. For example, older adults often show preserved recognition despite impaired free recall. By including all three paradigms, REMEMVR captures a more complete picture of episodic memory reconstruction than any one paradigm alone could provide.
3.4.5	Confidence Measurement
To capture meta-memory processes and distinguish genuine recall from guessing, participants rated their confidence in each response using a 5-star Likert scale. While a continuous slider would have permitted greater response granularity, this option was not implemented due to concerns about increased cognitive load, potential participant fatigue, and technical constraints within the Formidable Forms WordPress plugin. The 5-star format was thus selected for its simplicity, cultural familiarity, and minimal demand on participants' attentional resources. 
It is important to note that the use of Likert-type confidence ratings can introduce response biases. Participants may differ in how they interpret or utilise the scale. For example, some individuals may apply a dichotomous approach (selecting only extreme values such as 1 or 5), while others may avoid extreme responses entirely (restricting themselves to ratings between 2–4). Because of these individual response tendencies, confidence data required rigorous post hoc correction to minimise bias and maximise comparability across participants prior to its use in subsequent analyses (see 4.X.X). These corrections were essential given that confidence data were integrated both descriptively (to characterise memory processes) and inferentially (as priors or weights in probabilistic modelling frameworks, including a planned conditional probability model). For the purposes of modelling, confidence levels were scaled from 1–5 to a 0–1 interval and normalised per participant to adjust for scale usage variability.
Confidence ratings allowed each item response to be classified into four distinct behaviours depending on the combination of response accuracy and confidence level. These states are summarised in Table X.
Table X
Behavioural classification of memory responses as a function of accuracy and confidence.
Item Score	Confidence	Behaviour	Informative Value
Correct	High	Accurate episodic reconstruction	Strong indicator of episodic memory fidelity
Correct	Low	Random Guessing	Weak indicator of episodic memory fidelity
Incorrect	High	False memory insertion	Informative for maladaptive or distorted reconstruction processes
Incorrect	Low	Genuine forgetting	Strong indicator of episodic forgetting
Note: High/low confidence refers to its distance from each participant’s overall test mean confidence
3.4.6	Balancing Difficulty and Adaptability
Pilot testing played a critical role in calibrating the difficulty of REMEMVR. Early versions often overwhelmed participants, particularly older adults, due to excessive item interactions and memory test length. Notably, it was observed that making the task content too rich or the test too long/difficult often flummoxed older pilot testers and they disengaged with the task. To prevent floor effects due to motivational collapse, the number of rooms was reduced from six to four, and item count per room was cut from eight to six. Questions were refined to prioritise clarity and discriminability, ensuring participant scores on test one remained between 60–80% correct.
3.5	ENVIRONMENT AND ITEM DESIGN
3.5.1	Why Household Rooms?
One of the core design decisions in REMEMVR was the use of common household environments, specifically, a bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, and living room, as the immersive settings in which episodic memories would be formed. These room types were selected for their universal familiarity among the general population in Western contexts and for their feasibility within the technical and time constraints of the project. More open or complex environments such as parks, shops, or offices were considered but ultimately rejected due to the prohibitive demands of building such scenes in Unity as a solo and inexperienced VR developer. In contrast, domestic spaces offered a balance between ecological plausibility and practical implementability.
Importantly, these environments provided a highly controlled yet intuitively familiar spatial scaffold. To ensure cross-room comparability, a strict set of standardisation rules was applied during the design phase. Each room contained: (1) a unique wall and floor texture, (2) one or two windows with visually distinctive weather conditions outside, (3) a clock mounted on the wall indicating the time of day, (4) four fixed large furniture or fixture items, each placed in one of the room’s corners, (5) one salient incongruent but non-interactable object (e.g., a tyre in the bathroom), and (6) two AI-generated wall pictures, one of a person and one of a landscape, standardised in format and placement.
Ambient lighting and sound were tailored per room but kept within comparable parameters. For instance, the bathroom included the sound of running water and visible falling water particles from the showerhead, while the living room featured the sound of a thunderstorm paired with visible rain through the window. This multisensory integration aimed to support immersion and context-dependent memory encoding, while still maintaining uniformity in perceptual complexity across environments.
Although I designed REMEMVR primarily for an Australian participant sample, cultural generalisability was considered. The rooms avoided region-specific cues and relied on globally recognisable elements. No participants reported unfamiliarity with any of the room layouts or objects. Nonetheless, future iterations of REMEMVR may benefit from including post-room familiarity ratings or enabling culturally adaptive room packs to support more diverse use cases.
3.5.2	Object Categories and Placement
Objects within REMEMVR were categorised into three types: congruent (strongly associated with the room, e.g., a toothbrush in the bathroom), incongruent (contextually inappropriate or surprising, e.g., a hammer in the bathroom), and common (neutral but plausible, e.g., a book in any room). Each room contained exactly six interactive items, two from each category, enabling balanced within-room comparisons and cross-room consistency.
Object selection was constrained by the availability of free-to-use 3D models, a limitation that significantly influenced some design decisions. Rather than starting with a theoretical list of ideal objects and sourcing or commissioning 3D models of those objects accordingly, the selection process was inverted: a pool of available 3D assets was assessed for recognisability, semantic category, and the availability of visually similar “foil” versions for use in recognition testing. This ensured that every included item could be reliably tested across free recall, cued recall, and recognition paradigms.
The spatial placement and movement of objects were fully counterbalanced. At the start of each room, four items were located within the room and two in an adjacent “no-context” space consisting of four numbered pedestals. Movement types were pre-specified such that in each room: one item moved from the no-context room into the room, two moved from the room into the no-context room, one moved entirely within the no-context room, and two moved within the room itself. These permutations were designed to break any identifiable patterns between rooms that might be used as mnemonic shortcuts. Items were also placed such that each occupied a unique quadrant or surface area (e.g., no two items on the same pedestal or corner), preventing encoding overlap and supporting spatial analysis during recall.
While all six items in each room were interactive, each VR session also included seven observation tasks (e.g., describing the weather, counting doors) interleaved with six object interactions. This structure mirrored naturalistic memory formation, where some elements of a scene are actively manipulated while others are passively observed. Notably, one incongruent item in each room was also mildly hazardous (e.g., a battery-drill or motor oil), included as an exploratory probe into salience-driven encoding.
Semantic overlap between items across rooms was deliberately minimised to reduce interference. For instance, no room contained multiple types of books, containers, or tools, and foil items used in recognition tests were semantically close but distinct (e.g., several types of battery-drills). While item naming errors were rare, any non-English or alternative lexical labels provided by participants during VR exploration (e.g., “lavabo” for sink) were incorporated into their subsequent test questions, ensuring scoring validity.
Overall, the environment and item design in REMEMVR reflected a rigorous balancing of experimental control, ecological plausibility, and technical feasibility. The result was a set of immersive, memory-evoking experiences in which participants could interact with richly contextualised objects, allowing for nuanced analyses of episodic memory structure and content.
3.6	THE ROLE OF INTERACTION AND MOVEMENT
One of REMEMVR’s central design principles was to recreate the active, embodied nature of real-life experience. In contrast to traditional memory tasks that rely on passive observation or static list learning, REMEMVR required participants to physically move through space and interact with objects using naturalistic motor actions. This deliberate emphasis on sensorimotor realism was driven by both practical and theoretical considerations.
3.6.1	Locomotion and Spatial Immersion
Participants navigated each virtual room by walking in an open-plan 8 × 5 metre physical space, mapped in real time to a 1:1 spatial correspondence in VR. This approach was chosen to eliminate the sensory mismatch responsible for motion sickness in VR locomotion methods such as joystick-based movement or teleportation. Unlike seated or on-rails systems, free ambulation allows participants to develop egocentric spatial representations and activate the hippocampal spatial navigation network, specifically place cells and grid cells thought to support the encoding of scene structure and self-location in episodic memory traces (see 1.3). While not directly recorded due to significant technical complexity and time constraints, this form of encoding more closely mirrors the way episodic memories form in real-world settings: by embedding semantic details within spatial trajectories and bodily actions.
Safety was ensured using a triple-layered system: the Oculus boundary mesh warned users as they approached edges, virtual walls in each room were inset from the edge of the physical space, and the experimenter visually monitored participants throughout the session. Across all 100 participants, no collisions, disorientation, or navigation problems were encountered.
3.6.2	Hand Tracking and Embodied Interaction
Object interaction was implemented by reverse engineering Oculus Quest Pro’s native hand tracking system such that it could be incorporated into my custom application. To pick up items, participants could move their hand close to an item and make a fist, causing the item to swap its anchor point to the participant’s virtual hand, and could be released by the participant opening their hand. While developing this functional aspect presented significant technical challenges, this method of interaction was intuitive for users and required no instruction or guidance beyond the initial tutorial. Crucially, it removed the need for physical controllers, which early pilot testing had shown to be a source of anxiety and cognitive overload, particularly among older or VR-inexperienced participants. The absence of buttons also removed unnatural interface mechanics that could reduce immersion, distract from encoding, or generally compromise ecological validity.
Although current VR hardware cannot replicate texture, weight, or other tactile feedback properties, the use of a closed fist provided minimal proprioceptive input that distinguished object-holding states from empty-handed states. This modest sensorimotor realism, combined with realistic object physics, improved the believability of interaction without requiring additional equipment.
3.6.3	Interaction and Episodic Encoding
From a theoretical standpoint, allowing participants to manipulate objects was intended not only to increase immersion, but to shift memory encoding from passive registration to active engagement. According to embodied cognition frameworks, action-based exploration enhances the salience, accessibility, and trace richness of episodic content (see 1.3.3). In REMEMVR, each interactive event, e.g., picking up a book and placing it beside a sink, produced a unique binding of spatial, semantic, temporal, and motor information. These bindings, in turn, provided multiple potential retrieval cues and restrictions across testing formats. In contrast to static tasks, which often conflate exposure with encoding, this design aimed to ensure that each tested item had been actively experienced in situ.
While no passive-viewing control group was included, due to time and technical constraints, the robust memory effects observed suggest that interaction likely contributed meaningfully to encoding fidelity and realism. Future studies may wish to isolate this component more formally, but for the present study, embodied engagement was considered a necessary ingredient for replicating the richness of real-world episodic memory.
3.7	TEMPORAL DESIGN AND FORGETTING
A core aim of REMEMVR was to characterise how episodic memory decays over time in a naturalistic yet controlled setting. To this end, the study adopted a one-week longitudinal test schedule, with assessments conducted on Day 0 (immediate recall), Day 1, Day 3, and Day 6. This temporal structure was guided by the exponential nature of forgetting described by Ebbinghaus, which has since been supported by modern consolidation theories emphasising the critical role of sleep in memory stabilisation.
The chosen delays align with theoretical inflection points in the memory decay curve, Day 1 captures early consolidation after a single night’s sleep, Day 3 captures intermediate retention, and Day 6 provides insight into longer-term resilience. By spacing test intervals logarithmically (0, 1, 3, 6 days), the study balances theoretical relevance with practical feasibility, avoiding floor effects associated with overly long delays and redundancy from excessively short ones.
Each time point tested a different room to eliminate re-encoding confounds. Repeating the same room’s test multiple times would induce artificial memory stabilisation via retrieval practice and cue exposure. This would be particularly problematic for a subsequent test’s free-recall questions given the exposure to recognition stimuli in the previous test. To further prevent contamination, test questions and foil options were carefully constructed to avoid any overlap between rooms. For instance, incorrect choices in a recognition task were never semantically or visually similar to real items in any of the other rooms, minimising cross-test interference. This decision was made after pilot testers reported that seeing an item from the kitchen as a foil in the bathroom test, rather than potentially capturing a false memory, instead reminded them of the kitchen task’s content. This made recollection in the subsequent kitchen test not truly representative of the intended delay between encoding and recall. This design decision, however, created a significant challenge in creating a large number of foils. Twenty-four correct items (six per room) needed 168 verbal foils (seven per item), and 120 visual foils (five per item). Similarly, the four portrait and landscape paintings required 56 visual foils (seven per painting). To compound this difficulty, visual foils needed to be thematically similar in style to the correct answer. For example, all item foil images had to be in the same style of 3D model, and all painting foil images needed to be in the same painting style, only differing in content. Examples of all foil words and images can be found in Appendix X.
Beyond raw recall scores, I ensured REMEMVR’s temporal design enabled a rich modelling of individual memory trajectories. Using this multi-room, multi-day, multi-test design, participant performance across the four time points could be decomposed into:
-	Intercept: A proxy for baseline episodic memory capacity (trait),
-	Slope: The rate of decay or forgetting (resilience),
-	Residuals: Day-to-day fluctuations, reflecting state-based variance (e.g., tiredness, effort, distraction).
While this framework echoes mixed-effects regression modelling, test items could not be considered as independent. For example, it is possible for participants to recall moving “something” from location A to location B, implying accurate spatial memory. However, the difficulty of answering an item’s “where” question correctly depends on the availability of cues from that item’s “what” and “when” information. Similarly, if a participant correctly names an item in the free-recall section with high confidence, the difficulty in correctly recognizing the same item in the item recognition section cannot be considered equal to a participant who could not recall the item in the free-recall section. Thus, inferring memory ability in one domain as a function of item difficulty becomes conditionally probabilistic on the availability of cuing information from other domains, violating the assumptions of most frequentist statistical computation methods. This complication presented a significant challenge for conducting a statistically valid analysis and required me to create a custom Bayesian modelling pipeline to account for inter-item dependencies (see 4.X.X). 
3.8	TESTING PARADIGM ARCHITECTURE
A core component of REMEMVR's design was its multi-paradigm testing architecture, which integrated three distinct modes of episodic memory retrieval: free recall, cued recall (more accurately conceptualised as partial prompt recall), and recognition. Each retrieval paradigm reflects a different level of memory support and models different mechanisms of recall, allowing for a richer, more nuanced understanding of how participants access episodic content under varying levels of cognitive demand.
Free recall sections required participants to generate text-based responses without any cues, representing the most effortful and unconstrained form of memory retrieval. In contrast, the cued recall sections provided schematic diagrams of the room layout, along with multichoice item names and semantically similar foils. For example, ‘prescription glasses’ was foiled with options like ‘sunglasses’ for objective similarity, and ‘earbuds’ for similarities in utility. While providing potential names of items could be considered recognition, this was intended to help understanding how spatial and temporal reconstruction might be affected by these cues. Finally, the recognition section provided participants with a set of visual options, such as multiple-choice item and painting photos alongside visually similar foils and asked them to identify previously encountered stimuli.
This structured layering of paradigms was not arbitrary. Decades of memory research, both behavioural and neuroimaging, have demonstrated that free recall and recognition engage distinct neural systems and cognitive processes. Free recall often relies on strategic search and reconstruction from incomplete engrams, while recognition is more reliant on familiarity signals and perceptual matching. Including both allowed me to differentiate participants whose difficulties may arise from search and reconstruction processes, versus those with degraded or absent memory traces. The intermediate, prompt-based cued recall paradigm allowed for additional resolution, as it captured how subtle contextual cues might reactivate partially degraded episodic representations. Though “cued recall” is the conventional label, the specific format used here is more similar to what some have called partial cue reinstatement.
Importantly, the test sections were presented in a fixed order for all participants: free recall, followed by cued recall, and concluding with recognition. This sequencing was essential to avoid contamination effects, particularly the well-known risk that recognition tasks can artificially inflate subsequent recall accuracy. Free recall had to come first to preserve its status as an unconstrained probe of memory. While randomising the test order was briefly considered, it was ultimately rejected due to the risk of cue-driven reencoding and the additional complexity it would introduce in test administration and analysis. This structure also served an important motivational purpose. By placing the most difficult tasks first and progressively increasing retrieval support, participants were more likely to remain engaged across the entire test. This progressive structure helped accommodate individual variability in ability and reduced dropout or disengagement from test fatigue.
Finally, all four REMEMVR tests used an identical structure and format, with the only difference being the room being tested and the delay since encoding. This consistency maximised comparability across time points and allowed memory decay trajectories to be analysed in a principled way. While repeated exposure to the same question types could have introduced minor practice effects, the tests were explicitly designed to avoid any cross-contamination of content. Participants were never tested on the same room twice, and foils were selected carefully to avoid semantic or perceptual overlap between rooms.
Despite the limitations inherent in any memory assessment, the design of the REMEMVR testing structure continually prioritised experimental rigour, theoretical depth, and participant usability. By incorporating multiple retrieval paradigms, confidence ratings, and a thoughtful progression of difficulty, it offers a multidimensional and temporally sensitive profile of episodic recall, positioning it as a powerful tool for both measurement and theory development.
3.9	INCIDENTAL ENCODING AND MEMORY STRATEGIES
As discussed in 2.1, one of the central challenges in episodic memory research is disentangling naturalistic memory performance from the application of conscious memorisation strategies. Traditional episodic memory assessments, such as word list recall or paired-associate tasks, frequently create artificial testing conditions in which participants are aware of the nature of the recall questions and have opportunity during encoding to deliberately apply mnemonic strategies to maximise recall performance. This introduces substantial variability in the cognitive processes being measured. For example, one participant might spontaneously generate a semantic narrative linking list items, while another relies purely on immediate repetition or fails to develop any strategy at all. The resulting scores may thus reflect not only differences in memory ability, but also differences in metacognitive awareness, strategic flexibility, and prior experience with test-like situations.
A defining design principle of REMEMVR was to avoid directly encouraging the use of deliberate encoding strategies during the initial VR experience. Participants were aware that their participation involved memory research but were given no information about the nature or content of subsequent test questions. Critically, all instructions during the VR encoding phase were highly standardised and purely task-oriented, focusing participants’ attention on interacting with the environment rather than on intentional memorisation. Moreover, the sequence of actions within each VR room was deliberately varied across rooms, with no simple task order repetition that might facilitate the development of rote rehearsal strategies. In this way, REMEMVR sought to approximate the kind of incidental encoding that occurs during real-world experiences: participants engaged naturally with the virtual environments, but without foreknowledge of what details would later be probed such that their behaviour during encoding would be significantly altered.
While strict incidental encoding is never fully achievable in laboratory settings, especially once participants complete their first test and become familiar with the task structure, I incorporated a post-test strategy questionnaire to monitor potential shifts in participant behaviour over time. After each testing session, participants were asked whether they applied any specific strategies to help recall items or locations, whether they employed mnemonic techniques (e.g., method of loci, visual imagery), and how often they ruminated about the VR experience between sessions. These self-report data serve both as descriptive metadata and as potential covariates for modelling performance variability. For example, individuals who engaged in high levels of rehearsal between sessions may exhibit flatter forgetting slopes that reflect strategic maintenance rather than purely intrinsic consolidation processes.
3.10	CULTURAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC GENERALISABILITY
While the initial version of REMEMVR was designed for a Western cultural context, I developed it with adaptability in mind. The core architectural principle of REMEMVR is modularity, enabling future tailoring to more diverse populations across language, culture, and age groups, without compromising the integrity of the experimental framework.
3.10.1	Cultural Relevance and Room Design
The selection of household environments (bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, living room) was informed by their presumed universality within Western cultures and their relative ease of implementation using existing Unity assets. These environments were chosen to strike a balance between ecological familiarity and practical constraints of single-developer asset creation. While no formal cultural validation study was conducted, none reported unfamiliarity with the presented environments. Anecdotal evidence from international student participants revealed no difficulties understanding the rooms or object contexts, suggesting at least preliminary cross-cultural applicability within English-speaking populations.
3.10.2	Language and Semantic Flexibility
To accommodate linguistic diversity, I included an administrative backend allowing custom object naming on a per-participant basis. If a participant used a non-English label for an object (e.g., French “lavabo” for “sink”), this label was substituted throughout the subsequent memory test for this participant. While this dynamic tagging and participant bespoke test generation system presented a significant technical challenge, it ensured that participants were not penalised for linguistic or cultural variation in vocabulary, thus improving the fairness and validity of scoring. 
3.11	DIAGNOSTIC AND SCIENTIFIC UTILITY
I designed REMEMVR not only as a research tool, but as a prototype for a next-generation clinical memory assessment system. Its longitudinal design, multidimensional scoring structure, and ecologically enriched encoding protocol make it well-suited for both basic science and translational applications in the field of episodic memory.
3.11.1	A Multidimensional Longitudinal Metric
Traditional episodic memory assessments such as the RAVLT and Logical Memory subtests tend to produce unidimensional scores, usually reflecting raw recall totals at short delay intervals. REMEMVR, by contrast, captures memory performance across four days (0, 1, 3, and 6), spanning what–where–when dimensions and confidence ratings within free recall, cued recall, and recognition paradigms. This structure enables the derivation of nuanced, longitudinal memory trajectories that reflect more than just performance at a single timepoint.
From an analytical perspective, REMEMVR data allows for the separation of three core components of memory ability:
-	Trait-level ability: captured by the intercept of the decay curve (i.e., Day 0 performance), reflecting general episodic memory capacity.
-	Decay slope: representing how rapidly a participant forgets information over time, a potential index of consolidation efficiency or memory resilience.
-	State variability: assessed by the noise or residual error around a participant’s individual decay curve, which may reflect fatigue, distraction, or other state-based influences.
Such a structure is currently not possible with existing brief assessments and introduces a richer set of variables for diagnostic interpretation, particularly in longitudinal studies or clinical trials.
3.11.2	Informing Traditional Test Interpretation
Preliminary analyses suggest that performance on REMEMVR is not well predicted by standard cognitive tools such as the RAVLT, BVMT-R, or Raven’s Progressive Matrices. This discrepancy highlights REMEMVR’s potential to uncover facets of episodic memory not captured by existing instruments. One scientific application is to use REMEMVR as a benchmark for refining how we interpret existing tools. For instance, applying data-driven techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA) to legacy test data may reveal new factor structures that better predict REMEMVR outcomes, offering a way to improve the construct validity of current neuropsychological batteries.
3.11.3	Profiling Memory Disorders
Because REMEMVR evaluates memory across semantic, spatial, and temporal domains, with and without retrieval support, it is well positioned to help differentiate between memory impairment profiles. A participant with early Alzheimer’s disease might show steep forgetting slopes and poor recognition, whereas a participant with frontal amnesia may recall fewer details in free recall but perform relatively well in recognition. With sufficient normative data, REMEMVR could be used to identify signatures of early-stage cognitive decline or specific domain impairments (e.g., spatial vs. semantic), supporting earlier and more precise clinical diagnoses.
3.11.4	Deployment in Clinical and Translational Settings
REMEMVR’s browser-based testing format, coupled with a portable VR setup, enables it to be deployed in memory clinics, rural healthcare settings, or longitudinal aging studies. In principle, it could be used for annual cognitive check-ups, allowing clinicians to track subtle changes in memory performance over time using a consistent and richly informative metric. Because of its controlled encoding environment, REMEMVR also lends itself well to within-subject experimental designs, making it ideal for evaluating interventions such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), pharmacological trials, or cognitive training programs. This was a central motivation behind REMEMVR’s development: to create a tool sensitive enough to detect changes over time and robust enough to isolate the effects of treatment from natural fluctuations in memory performance.
3.11.5	Vision for Expansion
Although this version of REMEMVR was designed and deployed by a single researcher under tight constraints, its architecture was built with extensibility in mind. Future iterations could include normative reference data across age groups, cultural adaptations, and clinician-facing dashboards for visualising memory trajectories. REMEMVR’s integration into translational neuroscience pipelines, particularly in studies aiming to enhance or preserve memory function through biological interventions, would allow researchers to quantify real-world memory improvements with higher precision than ever before. Future research directions are discussed in more detail in X.X.X
