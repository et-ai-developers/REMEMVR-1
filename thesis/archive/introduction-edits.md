### 1.3.4 Schema Theory and Semantic Congruence

While the frameworks discussed above focus on neural architecture and cognitive processes, schema theory addresses how pre-existing knowledge structures influence episodic encoding and retrieval. A schema is an organized knowledge structure that represents typical features, sequences, and relationships within a familiar context (Bartlett, 1932). For example, a "bathroom schema" includes expectations about typical objects (soap, towels), spatial arrangements (sink near mirror), and functional relationships (toothbrush stored near sink). These semantic frameworks profoundly shape how episodic memories are formed and later reconstructed.

When encoding new episodic experiences, schema-consistent information benefits from automatic integration with existing knowledge structures. A toothbrush encountered in a bathroom is rapidly assimilated into the bathroom schema, requiring minimal cognitive effort and benefiting from rich associative networks during consolidation (Alba & Hasher, 1983). This integration hypothesis predicts that schema-congruent items should be more resistant to forgetting, as retrieval can be supported by semantic cues and reconstructive processes guided by schematic knowledge (Ghosh & Gilboa, 2014).

Conversely, schema-inconsistent or incongruent information presents a paradox. On one hand, schema violations are distinctive and salient, potentially triggering enhanced encoding via the Von Restorff effect (Hunt, 1995). A hammer encountered in a bathroom violates schematic expectations, creating a "prediction error" that captures attention and may strengthen the initial memory trace (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972). On the other hand, incongruent items lack the integration support enjoyed by congruent items. During consolidation, particularly sleep-dependent memory processing, schema-consistent information may be preferentially strengthened through hippocampal-cortical dialogue, while schema-inconsistent information remains hippocampus-dependent and vulnerable to interference (Stickgold & Walker, 2013; Tamminen et al., 2010).

These competing mechanisms generate opposing predictions for long-term episodic retention. If encoding strength dominates, incongruent items should show initial advantages that persist over time. If consolidation and integration dominate, incongruent items should show rapid forgetting despite potentially stronger initial encoding. Empirical evidence remains mixed: some studies report enhanced memory for schema-inconsistent information (Rojahn & Pettigrew, 1992), while others find advantages for schema-consistent material (Bower, Black, & Turner, 1979), likely depending on retention interval, depth of processing, and the nature of the schema violation.

For the present research, REMEMVR's design explicitly manipulates semantic congruence by including common items (schema-neutral), congruent items (bathroom-appropriate), and incongruent items (bathroom-inappropriate) within each virtual environment. This allows systematic examination of how schematic support influences episodic forgetting trajectories across multiple days, a timescale sufficient for consolidation processes to operate. By testing memory at immediate (Day 0), short-delay (Day 1), and longer-delay intervals (Days 3 and 6), we can distinguish between encoding-driven effects (which should manifest immediately) and consolidation-driven effects (which should emerge across the retention interval, particularly following sleep-dependent processing between Day 0 and Day 1).

### 1.4.4 Aging and Episodic Memory

Episodic memory performance declines across the adult lifespan, with measurable deficits emerging as early as the fourth decade and accelerating in later years (Rönnlund et al., 2005). This decline is not uniform across all memory systems; episodic memory shows steeper age-related deterioration than semantic memory, procedural memory, or working memory (Park et al., 2002), making it one of the most age-sensitive cognitive domains and a critical target for early detection of pathological cognitive decline.

#### 1.4.4.1 Structural Changes

The neural substrates supporting episodic memory undergo substantial age-related changes. Volumetric studies using structural MRI consistently demonstrate progressive hippocampal atrophy beginning in middle age, with volume reductions of approximately 1-2% per year in older adults (Raz et al., 2005). This atrophy is not uniform across hippocampal subfields; the dentate gyrus and CA3 regions, critical for pattern separation and pattern completion respectively, show particularly pronounced age-related shrinkage (Small, Tsai, DeLaPaz, Mayeux, & Stern, 2002). Given these regions' essential roles in encoding distinct episodic traces and later retrieving them from partial cues, structural deterioration directly impacts core episodic memory processes.

Beyond the medial temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex thinning and white matter degradation disrupt the broader episodic memory network. Age-related reductions in prefrontal cortical thickness impair strategic encoding processes, source monitoring, and controlled retrieval (Rajah & D'Esposito, 2005). White matter hyperintensities and reduced fractional anisotropy reflect myelin breakdown and axonal damage, slowing communication between hippocampal and cortical regions essential for memory consolidation and retrieval (Gunning-Dixon & Raz, 2000). These structural changes create a "disconnection syndrome" whereby individual brain regions may remain relatively intact but their coordinated function deteriorates.

#### 1.4.4.2 Functional Changes

Functional neuroimaging reveals altered activation patterns in older adults during episodic memory tasks, even when behavioral performance appears intact. Older adults often show reduced hippocampal activation during encoding, suggesting less efficient memory formation (Daselaar et al., 2006). Paradoxically, they frequently exhibit increased prefrontal activation, interpreted as compensatory recruitment to offset declining hippocampal function—a pattern termed the "posterior-anterior shift in aging" or PASA (Davis et al., 2008). This compensation can maintain performance on easier tasks but proves insufficient when memory demands increase.

Aging also affects specific stages of episodic memory processing differentially. Encoding deficits are prominent, with older adults benefiting less from deep, elaborative processing strategies (Craik & Rose, 2012). They show particular difficulty binding multiple features (object, location, temporal context) into cohesive episodic representations, a deficit attributed to hippocampal dysfunction and impaired relational processing (Chalfonte & Johnson, 1996; Old & Naveh-Benjamin, 2008). Consolidation may also be compromised; older adults experience reduced slow-wave sleep and altered sleep architecture, potentially impairing sleep-dependent memory consolidation (Mander et al., 2013). Finally, retrieval processes suffer from reduced strategic search, increased susceptibility to interference, and impaired source monitoring—the ability to remember contextual details of when and where information was learned (Spencer & Raz, 1995).

#### 1.4.4.3 Domain-Specific Aging Effects

Critically for the present research, aging does not impact all episodic memory components equally. A robust finding across multiple studies is that older adults show disproportionate deficits in source memory (remembering contextual details like spatial location and temporal context) compared to item memory (remembering that an event occurred) (Spencer & Raz, 1995; Old & Naveh-Benjamin, 2008). This dissociation aligns with the binding deficit hypothesis: older adults struggle particularly with tasks requiring integration of information across multiple domains.

Spatial memory, dependent on hippocampal place cells and parahippocampal spatial processing, often shows pronounced age-related decline (Moffat, 2009). Older adults perform worse on virtual navigation tasks, real-world wayfinding, and spatial relocation tasks. Temporal memory—remembering when events occurred or their sequential order—also deteriorates substantially, possibly due to compromised prefrontal function governing temporal organization and monitoring (Parkin, Walter, & Hunkin, 1995).

In contrast, memory for object identity ("what" information), which can be supported by familiarity-based recognition and perirhinal cortex function, may show relative preservation (Yonelinas, 2002). This pattern suggests that memory domains reliant on contextual binding and hippocampal-dependent recollection are more vulnerable to aging than those supported by familiarity signals.

#### 1.4.4.4 Implications for Assessment

These age-related changes have profound implications for episodic memory assessment. Traditional tests often collapse across "what," "where," and "when" dimensions or emphasize verbal learning (e.g., word lists), potentially missing domain-specific vulnerabilities. Furthermore, most assessments probe memory after brief delays (20-30 minutes), insufficient to reveal consolidation deficits that manifest across days. An ideal assessment would (1) separately measure object, spatial, and temporal memory, (2) track forgetting across multiple days to capture consolidation processes, (3) provide sufficient ecological validity to reflect real-world episodic memory demands, and (4) offer enough measurement precision to detect subtle deficits in prodromal stages of cognitive decline.

The present research addresses these requirements through REMEMVR's design: stratified sampling across ages 20-70, separate measurement of What/Where/When domains, longitudinal testing across six days, and immersive VR encoding that approximates naturalistic episodic experience. By modeling age as both a predictor of baseline ability (intercept) and forgetting rate (slope), and testing for age × domain interactions, we can determine whether aging affects all episodic components uniformly or produces domain-selective vulnerabilities.

### 1.4.5 Individual Differences in Episodic Memory

Beyond age-related population trends, substantial individual variability exists in episodic memory ability. Even among young, healthy adults, performance on standardized memory tests spans a wide range, with some individuals consistently outperforming others across tasks and time points. Understanding the sources and stability of these individual differences is critical for both theoretical models of memory and clinical applications.

#### 1.4.5.1 Trait vs State Perspectives

Individual differences in memory performance can be conceptualized along a trait-state continuum. Trait-like characteristics represent stable, enduring individual attributes that persist across contexts and time, such as general cognitive ability (g-factor), working memory capacity, or genetically influenced neural efficiency (Ackerman & Beier, 2007). State-dependent factors, conversely, reflect transient influences such as fatigue, stress, sleep deprivation, or momentary attention fluctuations (Unsworth & Engle, 2007).

Episodic memory likely involves both components. Twin studies suggest moderate heritability (h² ≈ 0.3-0.5) for episodic memory performance, indicating genetic contributions to stable individual differences (Finkel & Pedersen, 2004). However, episodic memory also shows substantial within-person variability across testing sessions, influenced by sleep quality, emotional state, time of day, and interference from concurrent activities (Sliwinski et al., 2006).

The critical question for longitudinal memory research is whether forgetting rate—the slope of memory decline over time—represents a stable individual trait or merely reflects accumulated state-dependent noise. If forgetting rate is trait-like, individuals should show consistent patterns (fast vs slow forgetters) across memory domains and testing occasions. This would justify person-centered analytical approaches, such as latent class analysis or clustering, to identify forgetting "profiles." If forgetting rate is predominantly state-driven, focusing on average trajectories may be more appropriate.

#### 1.4.5.2 Sources of Individual Differences

Multiple factors contribute to stable individual differences in episodic memory. Structural brain differences, including hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, and white matter integrity, correlate with memory performance even in healthy populations (Van Petten, 2004). Functional differences in neural efficiency, measured via fMRI activation patterns during encoding and retrieval, also predict individual memory ability (Kirchhoff et al., 2000).

Beyond neural substrates, strategic and metacognitive factors play crucial roles. Individuals differ in their spontaneous use of elaborative encoding strategies, organizational schemes, and retrieval monitoring (Dunlosky & Hertzog, 1998). Some individuals naturally employ effective mnemonic techniques (e.g., visualization, semantic elaboration), while others rely on passive, shallow processing. These strategic differences can produce performance gaps as large as those attributable to age or cognitive capacity.

#### 1.4.5.3 Implications for Analysis

For the present research, individual differences manifest in random effects within linear mixed models. Random intercepts capture stable baseline differences in memory ability, while random slopes capture individual variation in forgetting rate. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for random slopes quantifies the proportion of slope variance attributable to stable between-person differences versus within-person variability. High ICC values (>0.40) suggest forgetting rate is a meaningful individual difference variable, justifying further investigation into its correlates and potential classification into distinct profiles.

### 1.5.7 Item-Level Variability and Forgetting

Beyond person-level individual differences, substantial variability exists at the item level. Not all memories are created equal; some items are encoded more strongly than others, even when exposure duration and attention are held constant. This item-level variability poses both a measurement challenge and a theoretical opportunity to understand how encoding strength relates to forgetting trajectories.

Classical memory theory, including Jost's Law (1897), proposed that older, weaker memories decay faster than newer, stronger memories—formalized as the "law of forgetting" where forgetting rate is inversely proportional to memory strength. However, empirical support for this relationship in episodic memory remains mixed. Some studies find that more difficult items (those with lower initial endorsement probability) show faster forgetting, consistent with strength-dependent decay (Wixted, 2004). Others find no relationship or even reversed patterns, where easily learned items show rapid initial forgetting due to ceiling effects or reduced distinctiveness (Underwood, 1964).

Item Response Theory (IRT) provides a framework for quantifying item-level properties independent of person ability. In IRT models, item difficulty represents the latent trait level at which an individual has a 50% probability of correct response. Items with high difficulty require high ability for successful recall; items with low difficulty are endorsed even by low-ability individuals. Importantly, IRT difficulty reflects average endorsement probability across the sample and time points, not necessarily encoding strength for any given individual at a specific moment.

Testing whether IRT difficulty moderates forgetting trajectories requires cross-level interaction models, where item-level predictors (Level 1: difficulty) interact with time to predict person-level outcomes (Level 2: memory trajectory). Such models are statistically complex, requiring crossed random effects for both persons and items, but provide direct tests of whether "hard" items forget differently than "easy" items.

For REMEMVR, item difficulty parameters estimated from pooled data (all participants, all time points) can be used to test difficulty × time interactions. If significant, this would suggest that item properties influence not just initial encoding, but also the rate of subsequent forgetting—a finding with implications for theories of memory consolidation and the design of future memory assessments.
