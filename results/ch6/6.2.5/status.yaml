    Analysis plan created: 6 steps planned (Step 0: data loading + age merge, Steps 1-5: LMM analysis + visualization prep).
    Tool requirements: LMM fitting (Age x Time interaction), age centering, Bonferroni correction (D068), age tertile aggregation, comparison to Ch5 age null pattern.
    Expected outputs: 8 data files (calibration with age, centered age, LMM results, age effects with dual p-values, age tertiles, Ch5 comparison), 6 log files. Validation required at every step.

    6 analysis + 6 validation tools cataloged for LMM Age x Time interaction analysis.
    Custom tools verified: fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr (tools.analysis_lmm).
    Stdlib tools exempted: pandas merge, transform, filter, groupby, concat.
    All validation tools verified against tools_inventory.md.
    Decisions embedded: D068 (dual p-values), D070 (TSVR time variable).
