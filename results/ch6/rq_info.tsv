6.1.1	Confidence	Model Selection	NEW	No	Which functional form best describes confidence decline over 6 days in VR episodic memory?	Exploratory analysis comparing 5 candidate models (Linear, Quadratic, Logarithmic, Linear+Logarithmic, Quadratic+Logarithmic) for confidence trajectories. Expected: Logarithmic model best (paralleling Ch5 accuracy findings). Akaike weight > 0.30 for best model. Rationale: If confidence tracks accuracy, both should show rapid early decline followed by asymptotic leveling.	Source: data/cache/dfData.csv. Variables: UID, TEST, TSVR (hours), TC_* confidence items (5-level Likert: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0). Sample: N=100 participants x 4 tests = 400 observations. Transformations: Days = TSVR_hours/24, Days_squared, log_Days_plus1. Note: TC_ tags are 5-category ordinal, NOT dichotomous like TQ_.	(0) Extract VR data, filter to TC_* confidence items for omnibus "All" factor. (1) IRT Pass 1: GRM (Graded Response Model) for 5-category ordinal data, single factor, p1_med prior. (2) Item purification (Decision D039): exclude items with |b| > 3.0 OR a < 0.4. (3) IRT Pass 2 re-calibration on purified items. (4) Merge theta_confidence with TSVR, create time transformations. (5) Fit 5 LMMs with REML=False: Linear, Quadratic, Logarithmic, Lin+Log, Quad+Log; all with random slopes by UID. (6) Model selection via AIC, compute Akaike weights. (7) Compare to Ch5 accuracy model selection (5.1.1).	data/step00_irt_input.csv; data/step00_tsvr_mapping.csv; data/step02_purified_items.csv; data/step03_theta_confidence.csv (400 rows); data/step04_lmm_input.csv (400 rows); results/step05_model_comparison.csv (5 models); data/step06_best_model.pkl; results/step06_aic_comparison.csv; results/step07_ch5_comparison.csv	IRT convergence: theta in [-4,4], SE in [0.1,1.5]. GRM for 5-category data (NOT 2PL). Purification: 30-70% retention. All 5 LMMs converge. Akaike weights sum to 1.0. Best model weight > 0.30. Comparison to Ch5 5.1.1 documented.
6.1.2	Confidence	Two-Phase Pattern	NEW	No	Does confidence decline show the same two-phase pattern (rapid early, slow late) as accuracy?	Confidence exhibits two-phase pattern paralleling accuracy: rapid decline Day 0->1, slower decay Day 1->6. Evidence: (1) significant quadratic term (p < 0.01 Bonferroni), (2) piecewise model AIC < continuous by > 2, (3) Late/Early slope ratio < 0.5. Rationale: Sleep-dependent consolidation should affect metacognitive monitoring similarly to memory traces.	DERIVED from RQ 6.1.1: results/ch6/6.1.1/data/step03_theta_confidence.csv, results/ch6/6.1.1/data/step00_tsvr_mapping.csv. Sample: N=100, 400 observations. Segments: Early (0-48h), Late (48-144h). Compare to Ch5 5.1.2 pattern.	(0) Load theta_confidence from RQ 6.1.1. (1) Create piecewise time variables (48h breakpoint). (2) Test 1: Fit quadratic model, test Time^2 significance (Bonferroni alpha=0.01). (3) Test 2: Fit piecewise model, compare AIC to continuous. (4) Test 3: Compute Early/Late slope ratio. (5) Compare pattern to Ch5 5.1.2 (accuracy two-phase).	results/step02_quadratic_model_summary.txt; results/step03_piecewise_comparison.csv; results/step04_slope_ratio.csv; results/step05_ch5_comparison.csv; plots/step06_twophase_theta_data.csv	All models converge. 2/3 tests support two-phase pattern (or NULL replicating accuracy). Comparison to Ch5 5.1.2 documented. Plot data complete.
6.1.3	Confidence	Age Effects	NEW	No	Does age affect baseline confidence or confidence decline rate?	Age will NOT significantly affect confidence decline rate, paralleling Ch5 null findings (5.1.3, 5.2.3, 5.3.4, 5.4.3 all NULL). Expected: Age_c on intercept may be marginal (older adults may be less confident overall), but Age_c × Time interaction NULL (p > 0.05). Rationale: VR ecological encoding creates age-invariant forgetting; metacognitive monitoring should parallel.	DERIVED from RQ 6.1.1: results/ch6/6.1.1/data/step03_theta_confidence.csv, results/ch6/6.1.1/data/step00_tsvr_mapping.csv. Age from data/cache/dfData.csv. Sample: N=100, 400 observations. Transformations: Age_c (centered), log_TSVR.	(0) Load theta_confidence + Age. (1) Center Age. (2) Fit LMM: theta ~ (Time + Time_log) × Age_c + (Time | UID). (3) Extract Age_c main effect and interaction terms, Bonferroni alpha=0.0167. Report dual p-values (D068). (4) Effect size at Day 6. (5) Age tertile plot. (6) Compare to Ch5 5.1.3.	data/step01_lmm_input.csv; results/step02_lmm_summary.txt; data/step03_age_effects.csv (dual p-values); results/step04_effect_size.csv; plots/step05_age_tertile_data.csv; results/step06_ch5_comparison.csv	Model converged. Age_c centered. Dual p-values present. Comparison to Ch5 5.1.3 (expect NULL replication). Plot: 12 rows (3 tertiles × 4 tests).
6.1.4	Confidence	ICC Decomposition	NEW	No	Is confidence decline trait-like or state-like? Does 5-level data reveal slope variance that dichotomous accuracy missed?	CRITICAL HYPOTHESIS: ICC_slope for confidence > 0.10 (detectable with 5-level ordinal data) while Ch5 accuracy ICC_slope ≈ 0 (dichotomous data limitation). Rationale: 5-level Likert provides 2.3× more information per response than 0/1. If ICC_slope_confidence > 0.10 but ICC_slope_accuracy ≈ 0, proves dichotomous data limited slope detection. If ICC_slope_confidence ≈ 0 too, confirms forgetting rate truly shows minimal trait variance.	DERIVED from RQ 6.1.1: results/ch6/6.1.1/data/step06_best_model.pkl. Sample: N=100, 400 observations. Compare directly to Ch5 5.1.4 ICC values.	(1) Load best LMM from RQ 6.1.1. (2) Extract variance components: var_intercept, var_slope, cov_int_slope, var_residual. (3) Compute ICC_intercept, ICC_slope_simple, ICC_slope_conditional at Day 6. (4) Extract 100 participant random effects. (5) Test intercept-slope correlation. (6) CRITICAL: Compare ICC_slope_confidence vs Ch5 ICC_slope_accuracy (0.0005). Test if significantly higher.	data/step02_variance_components.csv; data/step03_icc_estimates.csv; data/step04_random_effects.csv (100 rows, REQUIRED for 6.1.5); data/step05_intercept_slope_correlation.csv; results/step06_ch5_icc_comparison.csv (CRITICAL); results/step06_interpretation.txt	ICC in [0,1]. 100 random effects extracted. Intercept-slope correlation tested. CRITICAL: Ch5 comparison documented (ICC_slope_accuracy = 0.0005 vs ICC_slope_confidence = ?). Interpretation of design vs measurement effect.
6.1.5	Confidence	Trajectory Clustering	NEW	No	Do participants cluster into confidence phenotypes, and do they match accuracy phenotypes?	Expected 2-3 profiles paralleling Ch5 5.1.5 (Resilient vs Vulnerable). If confidence and accuracy phenotypes match, suggests integrated memory-metacognition system. If divergent, suggests dissociable systems (good memory + poor metacognition, or vice versa). K selected via BIC. Quality: silhouette > 0.40 threshold (may exceed Ch5 accuracy clustering due to richer 5-level data).	DERIVED from RQ 6.1.4: results/ch6/6.1.4/data/step04_random_effects.csv. Ch5 cluster labels from 5.1.5 for comparison. Sample: N=100, 2 clustering variables (intercept + slope).	(1) Load random effects from RQ 6.1.4. (2) Standardize to z-scores. (3) K-means K=1-6, select via BIC. (4) Fit final K-means (seed=42). (5) Validate: silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, Jaccard bootstrap. (6) Characterize clusters. (7) Cross-tabulate with Ch5 5.1.5 accuracy clusters.

Cluster sizes >= 10%. Silhouette computed (compare to 0.40 threshold). Ch5 crosstab and chi-square association test complete.
6.2.1	Calibration	Over Time	NEW	No	Does calibration (confidence-accuracy alignment) change from Day 0 to Day 6?	If confidence and accuracy decline in parallel, calibration should remain STABLE (no significant Time effect on calibration metric). If confidence lags behind accuracy decline, OVERCONFIDENCE emerges over time (calibration worsens). Calibration = Mean(Confidence) - Mean(Accuracy) per person per timepoint. Also: Brier score, Expected Calibration Error (ECE).	DERIVED: Accuracy theta from Ch5 5.1.1: results/ch5/5.1.1/data/step03_theta_scores.csv.

Calibration computed per person-timepoint. Brier and ECE computed. LMM converged. Time effect tested with dual p-values (D068).
6.2.2	Calibration	Over-Underconfidence	NEW	No	Do people become overconfident as memories fade?	Overconfidence (Calibration > 0, confidence exceeds accuracy) may INCREASE from Day 0 to Day 6 as accuracy declines faster than confidence adjusts. Test: significant positive Time × Calibration interaction. Secondary: Compute proportion of participants overconfident at each timepoint.	DERIVED from RQ 6.2.1: results/ch6/6.2.1/data/step02_calibration_scores.csv. Sample: 400 observations.	(0) Load calibration scores from 6.2.1. (1) Compute sign(calibration): overconfident (>0), underconfident (<0), calibrated (≈0). (2) Compute proportion overconfident at each timepoint. (3) Test trend: proportion overconfident ~ Time (logistic or linear). (4) Compute mean calibration by timepoint. (5) Plot overconfidence trajectory.	data/step01_calibration_classified.csv (400 rows, sign); results/step02_proportion_overconfident.csv (4 rows); results/step03_trend_test.csv; results/step04_mean_calibration.csv; plots/step05_overconfidence_trajectory.csv	Classification correct (3 categories). Proportion computed per timepoint. Trend test complete. Plot shows trajectory.
6.2.3	Calibration	Resolution Over Time	NEW	No	Does discrimination ability (resolution/gamma) decline as memory fades?	Resolution (ability to discriminate remembered from forgotten) may DECLINE from Day 0 to Day 6 as memory becomes noisier. Metric: Goodman-Kruskal gamma between confidence and correctness (item-level). Threshold: gamma > 0.50 = acceptable resolution.	Source: Raw item-level data from data/cache/dfData.csv. Both TQ_* (accuracy) and TC_* (confidence). Sample: ~68 items × 100 participants × 4 tests = 27,200 item-responses.	(0) Extract item-level TQ_ (accuracy) and TC_ (confidence). (1) Compute gamma per participant per timepoint. (2) Fit LMM: gamma ~ Time + (Time | UID). (3) Test Time effect on resolution. (4) Compute mean gamma by timepoint. (5) Test if gamma stays > 0.50 threshold.

Gamma computed per person-timepoint. LMM converged. Time effect tested. Threshold comparison (gamma > 0.50) documented.
6.2.4	Calibration	By Accuracy Level	NEW	No	Are high vs low performers equally well-calibrated?	High baseline performers may be BETTER calibrated (metacognitive skill correlates with memory skill), showing smaller |calibration| and higher gamma. Test: interaction of Baseline_Accuracy × Calibration metrics. Alternative: Low performers are overconfident (Dunning-Kruger pattern).	DERIVED from RQ 6.2.1: calibration scores. RQ 6.2.3: gamma scores. RQ 6.1.1: theta_confidence Day 0 (baseline). Ch5 5.1.1: theta_accuracy Day 0 (baseline). Sample: 100 participants.

Calibration compared across tertiles. Dunning-Kruger hypothesis tested. Correlation computed.
6.2.5	Calibration	Age Effects	NEW	No	Does calibration decline faster for older adults?	Age will NOT significantly moderate calibration trajectory (Age × Time interaction NULL), consistent with Ch5 universal age null pattern. Older adults may show lower baseline calibration (overall less accurate) but same trajectory slope.	DERIVED from RQ 6.2.1: calibration scores. Age from data/cache/dfData.csv. Sample: 400 observations.	(0) Load calibration + Age. (1) Center Age. (2) Fit LMM: Calibration ~ Time × Age_c + (Time | UID). (3) Test Age_c main effect and interaction. (4) Age tertile comparison.

Age effects tested with dual p-values. Comparison to Ch5 age nulls documented.
6.3.1	Domain Confidence	Trajectories	NEW	No	Do What/Where/When domains show different confidence decline patterns?	NULL expected: Domain differences were NULL for accuracy in Ch5 5.2.1 (unitized encoding eliminates separation). If confidence parallels accuracy, domain × time interaction should be NULL. Possible exception: When domain (floor effect in accuracy) may show overconfidence (low accuracy but maintained confidence).	Source: data/cache/dfData.csv. Filter TC_* by domain tags: What (*-N-*), Where (*-L-*/*-U-*/*-D-*), When (*-O-*). Sample: N=100 × 4 tests × 3 domains = 1200 observations.

(4) Merge theta_confidence with TSVR. (5) Fit LMM with Domain × Time. (6) Post-hoc: What vs Where, When vs others. (7) Compare to Ch5 5.2.1.

Domain × Time tested. Ch5 comparison. When domain status documented.
6.3.2	Domain Confidence	Calibration	NEW	No	Are people better calibrated for some domains than others?	When domain may show BETTER calibration than What/Where despite floor effects: if both accuracy AND confidence are low, calibration = 0 (correctly uncertain).

6.3.4	Domain Confidence	ICC by Domain	NEW	No	Is confidence decline more trait-like for some domains?	ICC_slope may differ by domain. If 5-level data reveals slope variance (per 6.1.4), some domains may show higher ICC_slope than others. Compare to Ch5 5.2.6 (all ICC_slope ≈ 0 for accuracy).	DERIVED from RQ 6.3.1. Sample: 1200 observations (3 domains × 400).	(1) Fit domain-stratified LMMs with random slopes. (2) Extract variance components per domain. (3) Compute ICC per domain.

ICC computed per domain. Ch5 comparison documented.
6.4.1	Paradigm Confidence	Trajectories	NEW	No	Do Free Recall, Cued Recall, Recognition show different confidence decline?	NULL expected: Paradigm differences were NULL for accuracy slopes in Ch5 5.3.1-5.3.2 (retrieval support affects baseline, not decay). If confidence parallels accuracy, paradigm × time interaction should be NULL. Recognition may show HIGHEST baseline confidence (retrieval support creates illusion of remembering).	Source: data/cache/dfData.csv. Filter TC_* by paradigm tags: IFR, ICR, IRE. Sample: N=100 × 4 tests × 3 paradigms = 1200 observations.	(0) Extract TC_* by paradigm.

Paradigm × Time tested. Ch5 comparison documented.
6.4.2	Paradigm Confidence	Calibration	NEW	No	Are people better calibrated with more retrieval support?	Recognition may show OVERCONFIDENCE: high retrieval support creates fluent retrieval that feels like remembering even when accuracy is only moderate.

6.5.1	Schema Confidence	Trajectories	NEW	No	Do Common/Congruent/Incongruent items show different confidence decline?	NULL expected: Schema effects were NULL for accuracy in Ch5 5.4.1.

Congruence × Time tested. Ch5 comparison.
6.5.2	Schema Confidence	Calibration	NEW	No	Are people better calibrated for congruent items?

Calibration by congruence. Overconfidence hypothesis tested.
6.5.3	Schema Confidence	High-Confidence Errors	NEW	No	Do schema-incongruent items produce more high-confidence errors?	Incongruent items (schema-violating) may generate more high-confidence WRONG answers due to schema-based intrusions (remembering what "should" be there rather than what was). DRM effect analog. HCE = P(Accuracy=0 | Confidence >= 0.75).	Source: Item-level data from data/cache/dfData.csv. Both TQ_* and TC_*. Sample: ~27,200 item-responses.	(0) Extract item-level TQ_ and TC_.

LMM converged. Time effect tested.
6.6.2	HCE	Profiles	NEW	No	Who makes high-confidence errors? Individual difference predictors of HCE.	Low baseline performers may make more HCEs (poor memory + poor metacognition = Dunning-Kruger). High confidence bias individuals may make more HCEs. Age may NOT predict HCEs (paralleling Ch5 age nulls). Predictors: baseline accuracy, baseline confidence, age, confidence bias.	DERIVED: HCE rates from 6.6.1. Baseline accuracy from Ch5 5.1.1 Day 0. Baseline confidence from 6.1.1 Day 0. Age from dfData.csv. Confidence bias = Mean(confidence) - Mean(accuracy) at Day 0.

6.6.3	HCE	Domain Specificity	NEW	No	Are high-confidence errors domain-specific (more for What vs Where)?	When domain may show MOST HCEs due to floor effects (low accuracy) combined with guessing (which may feel confident).

6.7.1	Predictive	Day 0 Confidence	NEW	No	Does high initial confidence predict slower forgetting?	High Day 0 confidence may predict slower forgetting slope (well-encoded items have both high confidence and slower decay). Test: Day0_confidence × forgetting_slope correlation. Alternatively, confidence may NOT predict forgetting if metacognitive judgments are imperfect.	DERIVED: Day 0 confidence from 6.1.1 (theta at T1). Forgetting slope from Ch5 5.1.4 random slopes.

High within-person confidence variability (SD of confidence across items) may predict high within-person accuracy variability. Metacognitive noise may reflect encoding noise. Test: SD_confidence vs SD_accuracy correlation.	DERIVED: Item-level confidence and accuracy. Compute within-person SD at each timepoint.	(0) Compute within-person SD of confidence per timepoint.

Correlation tested. Direction documented.
6.7.3	Predictive	Calibration Predicts	NEW	No	Are well-calibrated people more stable forgetters?	Good calibration at Day 0 may predict more predictable (less variable) forgetting trajectories. Metacognitive skill may correlate with stable consolidation. Test: Day0_calibration vs trajectory_variability.	DERIVED: Day 0 calibration from 6.2.1. Trajectory variability = residual SD from LMM in Ch5 5.1.1.	(0) Load Day 0 calibration and trajectory residuals. (1) Compute individual trajectory variability (SD of residuals).

Direction documented.
6.8.1	Source-Dest Confidence	Trajectories	NEW	No	Do source (-U-) and destination (-D-) locations show different confidence decline?	Destination may show faster confidence decline (matching Ch5 5.5.1 accuracy pattern). Source-destination dissociation should replicate in confidence if it reflects fundamental memory processing difference. Test: LocationType × Time interaction.	Source: data/cache/dfData.csv.

Location × Time tested. Ch5 5.5.1 comparison.
6.8.2	Source-Dest Confidence	Calibration	NEW	No	Are people better calibrated for source or destination memory?	Source may be BETTER calibrated (lower uncertainty about pick-up locations, where initial object identification occurs). Destination may show overconfidence (put-down is automatic, feels familiar but decays faster). Test: LocationType × calibration.	DERIVED: Accuracy from Ch5 5.5.1, Confidence from RQ 6.8.1.
