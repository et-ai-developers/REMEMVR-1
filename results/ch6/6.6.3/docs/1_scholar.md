### Detailed Rubric Evaluation

#### 1. Theoretical Grounding (2.8 / 3.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Alignment with episodic memory theory
- [x] Domain-specific theoretical rationale
- [x] Theoretical coherence

**Assessment:**
The RQ demonstrates strong theoretical grounding by integrating dual-process theory, source monitoring framework, and consolidation theory to predict domain-specific patterns in high-confidence errors. The hypothesis that When domain will show highest HCE rates due to floor effects + guessing is theoretically coherent and well-motivated. The distinction between familiarity-based What memory and recollection-based Where/When memory provides clear rationale for differential metacognitive access across domains.

**Strengths:**
- Sophisticated integration of three complementary theoretical frameworks (dual-process, source monitoring, consolidation theory)
- Clear mechanistic predictions linking theoretical constructs to expected HCE patterns
- Explicit connection to Ch5 floor effects findings provides empirical grounding for When domain prediction
- Recognition that different memory processes (familiarity vs. recollection) have different metacognitive signatures

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Limited engagement with recent metacognitive domain-specificity literature (2020-2024)
- Could strengthen discussion of why confidence might NOT adjust for floor-level accuracy in When domain
- Missing explicit discussion of whether HCE rates reflect encoding quality differences vs. metacognitive monitoring failures

**Score Justification:**
Excellent theoretical integration with minor gaps in recent metacognition literature. The three-theory framework is coherent and generates testable predictions, but could be strengthened with explicit discussion of metacognitive monitoring processes and recent domain-specificity debates. Strong overall, warranting 2.8/3.0.

#### 2. Literature Support (1.7 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [ ] Recent citations (2020-2024) - Missing
- [x] Citation appropriateness for foundational theories
- [x] Coverage of major claims

**Assessment:**
The concept.md correctly identifies foundational theories (Yonelinas 2002, Johnson et al. 1993, Dudai 2004) but lacks recent citations validating current claims about high-confidence errors and domain-specific metacognition. The "[To be added by rq_scholar]" placeholder acknowledges this gap. Recent literature (2020-2024) has substantially advanced understanding of metacognitive domain-specificity, calibration vs. sensitivity, and the distinction between domain-general bias and domain-specific efficiency.

**Strengths:**
- Appropriate use of seminal dual-process theory (Yonelinas 2002)
- Source monitoring framework (Johnson et al. 1993) correctly applied to domain attribution challenges
- Consolidation theory (Dudai 2004) provides neural basis for domain differences

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- No citations from 2020-2024 validating HCE claims or domain-specific metacognition
- Missing literature on metacognitive calibration confounds with task difficulty
- No citations addressing practice effects on confidence in longitudinal VR studies
- Missing literature on encoding quality differences across domains in VR

**Score Justification:**
Foundational theories appropriately cited but critical gap in recent (2020-2024) literature. The placeholder "[To be added by rq_scholar]" indicates awareness of gap. Deducting 0.3 points for missing recent validation of HCE domain-specificity claims. Score: 1.7/2.0.

#### 3. Interpretation Guidelines (2.0 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Scenario coverage for expected result patterns
- [x] Theoretical connection in interpretation
- [x] Practical clarity for results-inspector

**Assessment:**
The concept.md provides comprehensive interpretation guidance through multiple mechanisms: (1) Expected Effect Pattern specifies significant Domain × Time interaction with exact predicted HCE rates (When >15%, What <10%, Where ~12%), (2) Success Criteria include domain ranking comparison to hypothesis prediction, (3) Analysis workflow includes Step 5 explicitly testing observed ranking against theoretical prediction (When > Where > What). This provides clear, actionable guidance for interpreting results.

**Strengths:**
- Quantitative predictions for each domain's HCE rate (When >15%, What <10%, Where ~12%)
- Expected interaction pattern clearly stated (Domain × Time, p <0.05 Bonferroni)
- Step 5 of workflow explicitly tests hypothesis prediction against observed ranking
- Success criteria include verification that ranking matches prediction
- Time effect prediction (increasing HCE as memories degrade but confidence fails to adjust) provides additional interpretive guidance

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
None identified - interpretation guidelines are comprehensive and actionable.

**Score Justification:**
Exceptional interpretation guidelines with quantitative predictions, explicit hypothesis testing in workflow, and clear success criteria. Full marks: 2.0/2.0.

#### 4. Theoretical Implications (2.0 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Clear contribution to episodic memory theory
- [x] Implications specificity and testability
- [x] Broader impact for VR memory assessment

**Assessment:**
The RQ makes clear theoretical contributions: (1) Tests whether metacognitive monitoring is domain-specific for What/Where/When episodic components, (2) Examines whether floor effects in accuracy (When domain from Ch5) combined with maintained confidence produces high-confidence errors, (3) Evaluates dual-process prediction that familiarity-based What memory has different metacognitive signature than recollection-based Where/When memory. Broader implications for VR memory assessment include understanding whether confidence ratings in VR tasks are calibrated differently across memory domains.

**Strengths:**
- Novel test of metacognitive domain-specificity using VR episodic memory paradigm
- Builds on Ch5 floor effects to test metacognitive failure hypothesis
- Clinical relevance: HCE patterns could inform which domains are most vulnerable to metacognitive errors in aging/impairment
- VR assessment implications: confidence calibration differences across domains inform test interpretation

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
None identified - theoretical implications are clearly stated and novel.

**Score Justification:**
Clear, novel contribution testing metacognitive domain-specificity with broader implications for VR assessment and clinical application. Full marks: 2.0/2.0.

#### 5. Devil's Advocate Analysis (0.8 / 1.0)

**Purpose:** Evaluate quality of this agent's generated scholarly criticisms.

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Two-pass WebSearch strategy conducted (validation + challenge)
- [x] 3-5+ substantive concerns identified via literature
- [ ] Both commission and omission errors comprehensively covered - Partial
- [x] Alternative frameworks and methodological confounds identified

**Assessment:**
This agent conducted 10 WebSearch queries across validation and challenge passes, identifying substantive concerns grounded in recent literature. Key criticisms include: (1) Practice effects confound (validated via longitudinal VR literature), (2) Encoding quality differences alternative explanation (validated via VR domain encoding literature), (3) Calibration confounds with task difficulty (validated via metacognition literature), (4) Missing recent domain-specificity debate (validated via 2020-2024 metacognition literature). However, some concerns could be strengthened with more specific CRITICAL vs MODERATE strength ratings and explicit rebuttals.

**Score Justification:**
Good devil's advocate analysis with literature-grounded criticisms, but could be more comprehensive in identifying CRITICAL omissions and providing strength-rated rebuttals. Score: 0.8/1.0.

---

#### Commission Errors (Critiques of Claims Made)

**Definition:** Claims in concept.md that are incorrect, misleading, outdated, or mischaracterized.

---

**1. Confidence Calibration Assumed Domain-Specific Without Recent Evidence**

- **Location:** Section 2: Theoretical Background - Dual-Process Theory paragraph
- **Claim Made:** "What memory can rely on familiarity (fast, automatic, high confidence), while Where and When require recollection (slow, effortful, more uncertain). Familiarity-based responses may generate more high-confidence errors when familiarity misleads."
- **Scholarly Criticism:** Recent metacognition research (2020) found that retrospective confidence judgments are domain-GENERAL, not domain-specific. Only feeling-of-knowing (FOK) judgments showed domain specificity. If confidence is domain-general, HCE rate differences may reflect task difficulty confounds rather than differential metacognitive access.
- **Counterevidence:** Baird et al. (2020, *Neuroscience of Consciousness*) demonstrated metacognitive domain specificity in feeling-of-knowing but NOT retrospective confidence. Confidence judgments showed cross-task correlations, suggesting domain-general mechanisms. Maniscalco et al. (2016) found metacognitive BIAS (overall confidence level) is domain-general trait, while metacognitive EFFICIENCY (sensitivity) is domain-specific.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "Acknowledge recent findings that retrospective confidence BIAS may be domain-general. However, metacognitive EFFICIENCY (ability to discriminate correct from incorrect responses using confidence) remains domain-specific and performance-dependent. HCE analysis focuses on calibration failures at floor-level performance (When domain), which may reveal domain-specific efficiency deficits even if overall confidence bias is domain-general. The hypothesis predicts domain × performance interaction on HCE rates, not simple domain main effect on confidence levels."

---

**2. Overinterpretation of Dual-Process Theory for Confidence Prediction**

- **Location:** Section 2: Hypothesis - Theoretical Rationale paragraph
- **Claim Made:** "What memory can rely on familiarity which, while potentially misleading, provides consistent confidence signals."
- **Scholarly Criticism:** Continuous dual-process (CDP) research shows familiarity does NOT provide independent confidence signals when recollection is strong. Familiarity only contributes to confidence when recollection is WEAK. This challenges the prediction that What domain has uniquely reliable familiarity-based confidence.
- **Counterevidence:** Research using joint rating scales found that recollection DOMINATED familiarity in confidence judgments - familiarity ratings were only predictive of confidence when recollection ratings were relatively weaker. When recollection was strong, familiarity made NO contribution to recognition confidence (cited from dual-process CDP literature review).
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "Revise to specify that What domain advantage in confidence calibration applies primarily when familiarity is STRONG and recollection is WEAK. In REMEMVR, object identity (What) may indeed engage strong familiarity (item previously seen) with weak recollection (specific encoding context degraded over retention interval), creating conditions where familiarity-based confidence is diagnostic. In contrast, Where and When inherently lack strong familiarity signals (locations/orders are arbitrary), requiring recollection that may fail without appropriate confidence adjustment."

---

#### Omission Errors (Missing Context or Claims)

**Definition:** Important theoretical context, alternative explanations, known confounds, or methodological limitations that are NOT mentioned in concept.md but SHOULD be for scholarly completeness.

---

**1. No Discussion of Practice Effects Across 4 Test Sessions**

- **Missing Content:** Concept.md does not acknowledge that participants complete the same VR memory test 4 times (Days 0, 1, 3, 6), which may produce practice effects on BOTH accuracy and confidence calibration.
- **Why It Matters:** Longitudinal memory research demonstrates large practice effects (effect sizes 0.70-0.87) with greatest gains at first retest. If practice improves accuracy more than confidence adjusts, HCE rates may DECREASE over time (opposite of decay prediction). Alternatively, if confidence inflates faster than accuracy improves, HCE rates may increase due to practice-induced overconfidence rather than memory decay.
- **Supporting Literature:** Theisen et al. (1998) found large practice effects on WMS-R memory tests across 4 administrations, with greatest increases at first retest (effect sizes 0.70-0.87 for General Memory and Delayed Recall indices). Recent VR research suggests practice effects persist in spatial memory with 7-day gaps (cited from 2023 VR spatial memory practice effects study).
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "How do you distinguish genuine memory decay effects from practice-induced changes in confidence calibration across the 4 test sessions? Could increasing HCE rates reflect practice-induced overconfidence rather than metacognitive failure to adjust for forgetting?"
- **Strength:** CRITICAL
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 7: Limitations or Section 4: Analysis Strategy - Acknowledge practice effects as potential confound. Explain that LMM random slopes (Time | UID) account for individual differences in practice trajectories. If practice effects are domain-general, Domain × Time interaction tests whether HCE trajectories differ beyond general practice patterns. However, if practice effects differ BY domain (e.g., spatial memory benefits more from practice than temporal memory), could confound interpretation. Consider testing whether Domain × Time interaction remains significant after controlling for overall accuracy changes (practice proxy)."

---

**2. Encoding Quality Differences Alternative Explanation Not Addressed**

- **Missing Content:** Concept.md does not consider that observed HCE domain differences might reflect INITIAL ENCODING QUALITY differences rather than differential metacognitive monitoring or decay processes.
- **Why It Matters:** VR research shows that navigationally-relevant objects engage BOTH ventral object stream AND dorsal spatial/MTL system, whereas temporal order encoding may be weaker. If What and Where are encoded more richly than When (due to task demands or neural engagement), lower HCE rates might reflect better encoding quality that supports accurate confidence, not superior metacognitive monitoring per se.
- **Supporting Literature:** Bonnici et al. (2018, *Hippocampus*) found spatial context encoded with greater hippocampal engagement than temporal context in VR. When objects are navigationally relevant (not just viewed passively), they engage qualitatively distinct attentional systems and both ventral and dorsal processing streams (cited from 2012 VR object-as-landmark study). VR encoding involves broader cortical network than 2D laboratory objects, suggesting domain-dependent encoding richness.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "How can you distinguish whether lower HCE rates in What/Where domains reflect better metacognitive monitoring versus richer initial encoding that provides more diagnostic cues for confidence? Both could produce the same HCE pattern."
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 2: Theoretical Background - Acknowledge encoding quality alternative. Explain that Day 0 (T1) baseline captures INITIAL encoding state, and longitudinal analysis tests whether HCE trajectories DIVERGE over time. If encoding quality alone explained domain differences, HCE rates should be stable across domains (parallel trajectories). Domain × Time interaction tests whether domains show DIFFERENTIAL changes in metacognitive calibration as memories decay, which cannot be explained by static encoding quality differences. However, acknowledge limitation that initial encoding quality may set ceiling/floor for subsequent metacognitive monitoring."

---

**3. Floor Effects May Inflate HCE Rates Mechanistically (Not Just Metacognitively)**

- **Missing Content:** When domain floor effects (low accuracy from Ch5) may produce HIGH HCE rates through RANDOM GUESSING with arbitrary confidence assignment, not necessarily metacognitive failure to adjust confidence for poor memory.
- **Why It Matters:** If participants are guessing randomly on When items (due to floor-level memory), they may assign confidence quasi-randomly or based on heuristics unrelated to memory strength (e.g., "I should be somewhat confident on at least some items"). This produces high-confidence errors mechanistically (guessing + arbitrary confidence >=0.75 by chance), not due to metacognitive monitoring failure. The hypothesis assumes maintained confidence reflects MONITORING FAILURE, but floor performance may reflect GUESSING, which has different theoretical implications.
- **Supporting Literature:** Overconfidence research shows confidence exceeds accuracy for hard questions on unfamiliar topics (Koriat et al., 1980 classic, cited via 2020 review). Metacognition literature warns that measures of relative metacognitive accuracy are CONFOUNDED with task performance in tasks that permit guessing - low performance tasks appear to have worse metacognition even with identical monitoring processes (cited from 2020 metacognition confound article).
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "When domain HCE rates may simply reflect random guessing with arbitrary confidence assignment. How does this differ theoretically from metacognitive failure to adjust confidence for poor memory? Both produce high-confidence errors, but implications differ."
- **Strength:** CRITICAL
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 2: Hypothesis or Section 5: Interpretation Guidelines - Distinguish two mechanisms for When domain HCE: (1) MONITORING FAILURE: memory trace exists but confidence fails to calibrate to weak trace strength, or (2) GUESSING + ARBITRARY CONFIDENCE: no memory trace, random guessing, confidence assigned based on heuristics (e.g., 'should be confident on some items'). Suggest examining confidence DISTRIBUTION in When domain: if monitoring failure, should see graded confidence inversely related to decay; if guessing, may see bimodal or uniform confidence distribution. Acknowledge that floor effects + HCE may reflect measurement artifact in addition to (or instead of) metacognitive failure."

---

**4. No Discussion of Confidence Rating Scale Properties**

- **Missing Content:** Concept.md does not discuss whether 5-level Likert confidence scale (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) produces floor/ceiling effects or response biases that could differentially affect domains.
- **Why It Matters:** If participants avoid extreme confidence levels (0 or 1.0) due to response bias, the HCE threshold (confidence >=0.75) may only capture "Absolutely Certain" responses (1.0), making HCE definition very conservative. Conversely, if participants overuse high confidence (response bias toward 0.75-1.0), HCE inflation could be scale artifact. Domain differences in HCE rates could reflect differential use of confidence scale across domains rather than metacognitive differences.
- **Supporting Literature:** Confidence level is related to probability and accuracy of revisions - responses with lower confidence were more often revised, and revisions were more accurate when initial response had some confidence than when guessing (cited from confidence revision literature). Guessing creates extra uncertainty in item responses, reflected in increased confidence interval estimates (cited from guessing + CI length article).
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Do participants use the confidence scale differently for What vs Where vs When domains? If When domain elicits more 'Guess/No Memory' responses (confidence=0) and fewer high-confidence responses, lower N for HCE analysis could affect statistical power for domain comparisons."
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 7: Limitations - Acknowledge that HCE threshold (confidence >=0.75) is somewhat arbitrary. Different thresholds (e.g., >=0.5) might reveal different domain patterns. Consider sensitivity analysis testing whether domain ranking (When > Where > What) holds across multiple HCE thresholds. Also note that methods.md specifies Likert response biases were identified and corrected prior to Bayesian modeling (Section 2.3.7), which may reduce scale artifact concerns."

#### Alternative Theoretical Frameworks (Not Considered)

**Definition:** Competing theories or alternative explanations that could account for expected results but are not discussed in concept.md.

---

**1. Task Difficulty Confound Alternative (Not Domain-Specific Metacognition)**

- **Alternative Theory:** Metacognitive efficiency is performance-dependent, not domain-specific per se. Domains that are more difficult (When floor effects) appear to have worse metacognition even with identical monitoring processes.
- **How It Applies:** When domain shows floor effects (Ch5) while What and Where domains have higher accuracy. Metacognition research warns that metacognitive sensitivity measures are CONFOUNDED with first-order performance - the same individual shows greater metacognitive sensitivity on easy tasks vs hard tasks. If performance is not matched between domains, erroneous conclusions about domain-specificity may be drawn.
- **Key Citation:** Fleming & Dolan (2012, *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B*) review "How to measure metacognition" emphasizes performance confounds. Maniscalco et al. (2016) developed meta-d' methodology specifically to separate metacognitive efficiency from performance differences. Recent metacognition research (cited from 2020 domain-specificity article) warns: "Measures of relative metacognitive accuracy are confounded with task performance in tasks that permit guessing."
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** If HCE domain differences simply reflect task difficulty (When is hard, What/Where are easier), this does NOT support domain-specific metacognitive ACCESS hypothesis. Instead, it suggests domain-GENERAL metacognitive monitoring applied to domains with different difficulty levels. Theoretical implications differ: domain-specific access suggests separate neural systems for monitoring different memory types; task difficulty confound suggests single monitoring system with performance-dependent sensitivity.
- **Strength:** CRITICAL
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** "Add to Section 2: Theoretical Background or Section 5: Interpretation Guidelines - Acknowledge task difficulty confound alternative. Explain that Domain × Time INTERACTION (not just Domain main effect) tests whether metacognitive calibration TRAJECTORIES differ beyond static difficulty differences. If task difficulty alone explained HCE domain differences, domains should show parallel HCE trajectories over time (all increase as forgetting occurs). Domain × Time interaction tests whether When domain shows ACCELERATING HCE trajectory (difficulty + forgetting) while What/Where show different patterns. However, acknowledge limitation that this analysis cannot fully deconfound domain-specificity from difficulty without matching baseline performance across domains (which is empirically impossible given observed floor effects)."

---

**2. Response Bias Framework (Not Metacognitive Monitoring Framework)**

- **Alternative Theory:** HCE domain differences may reflect RESPONSE BIAS differences across domains (e.g., tendency to guess conservatively on temporal items, liberally on object items) rather than metacognitive MONITORING differences.
- **How It Applies:** Signal detection theory distinguishes sensitivity (d') from response bias (criterion). HCE rates conflate accuracy (sensitivity) with confidence (criterion placement). Domains may differ in how participants set confidence criteria: object recognition may elicit liberal confidence criterion ("feels familiar, must be correct"), while temporal order may elicit conservative criterion ("not sure, better say low confidence"). This produces HCE domain differences through bias, not monitoring.
- **Key Citation:** Research on evidence reliability and decision confidence found that "confidence bias varies across individuals as a stable trait - one person might habitually express opinions with confidence regardless of veracity (overconfidence/high bias), while another may express carefully thought-through ideas with unwarranted caution (underconfidence/low bias)" (cited from confidence bias PMC article). This suggests confidence reflects individual response bias traits, not just memory strength monitoring.
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** If HCE domain differences reflect response bias (liberal confidence for What, conservative for When), this is NOT evidence for differential metacognitive ACCESS to memory domains. Instead, it suggests task characteristics elicit different response strategies. Theoretical implications differ: metacognitive access hypothesis suggests domains have different memory trace qualities that monitoring can detect; response bias hypothesis suggests domains elicit different strategic criterion placement.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** "Add to Section 5: Interpretation Guidelines - Consider response bias alternative when interpreting results. If What domain shows LOW HCE rates, could reflect: (1) genuinely better metacognitive access to object memory traces, OR (2) liberal confidence bias for familiar objects combined with high accuracy (produces many high-confidence CORRECT responses, few HCE). Conversely, When domain HIGH HCE rates could reflect: (1) poor metacognitive access to temporal traces, OR (2) random guessing with arbitrary confidence assignment (some guesses get confidence >=0.75 by chance). Suggest examining confidence distributions BY accuracy: do correct vs incorrect When responses show different confidence patterns? If monitoring is effective, incorrect responses should have systematically lower confidence than correct responses even within domain."

#### Known Methodological Confounds (Unaddressed)

**Definition:** Established methodological issues in VR memory research that could affect interpretation but are not mentioned in concept.md.

---

**1. VR Immersion May Differentially Affect Domain Encoding and Confidence**

- **Confound Description:** VR immersion creates richer contextual encoding than traditional 2D laboratory paradigms, but this richness may DIFFERENTIALLY benefit spatial (Where) vs temporal (When) memory, confounding domain comparisons.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** VR research shows encoding involves broader cortical network for VR vs 2D objects, suggesting VR-specific benefits for contextually-embedded memory. However, spatial context may benefit MORE from VR immersion than temporal context (which remains abstract sequencing even in immersive VR). This could artificially inflate Where vs When differences compared to non-VR paradigms, limiting generalizability.
- **Literature Evidence:** Simons et al. (2022, cited from VR encoding frontiers article): "Source analysis revealed multiple cortical generators for encoding in VR, suggesting involvement of broader network of cortical areas during encoding of virtual as opposed to conventional laboratory objects." VR spatial context engaged navigationally-relevant processing, while temporal context remained sequence-based. This suggests VR enhances spatial encoding more than temporal encoding.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** If VR differentially enhances Where encoding and confidence calibration (rich spatial cues support accurate confidence) but does NOT similarly enhance When encoding (abstract temporal sequences lack immersive cues), observed domain differences may be VR-specific rather than reflecting general episodic memory principles.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 7: Limitations - Acknowledge VR immersion may differentially benefit spatial vs temporal memory encoding and metacognition. This is both a strength (ecologically valid, tests real-world VR memory assessment) and limitation (may not generalize to non-VR episodic memory paradigms). Frame contribution as: 'Testing metacognitive domain-specificity in immersive VR contexts reveals how confidence calibration operates when spatial information is rich and temporal information is abstract, reflecting real-world episodic memory where spatial context is often more salient than temporal context.'"

---

**2. Latin Square Counterbalancing May Introduce Room-Specific Confounds**

- **Confound Description:** Methods.md specifies that room order and test timing were counterbalanced via Latin square stratified within age groups. However, if certain ROOMS (bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, living room) have inherently different memorability for specific domains (e.g., kitchen objects more distinctive than bedroom objects), room-specific effects could confound domain effects.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** If What domain HCE rates are lower partially because kitchen objects are highly distinctive (low familiarity-based errors), while When domain HCE rates are higher partially because temporal order in bathroom tasks is particularly confusing, then observed domain differences partly reflect room-specific content, not pure domain-specific metacognition.
- **Literature Evidence:** VR object-as-landmark research (cited from 2012 study) found that "when objects are navigationally relevant, they engage qualitatively distinct attentional systems." Different rooms may make objects differentially navigationally relevant (kitchen layout emphasizes object locations, bedroom layout emphasizes temporal routines), creating room × domain interactions.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** Item-level analysis (~27,200 item-responses) aggregates across 4 rooms × 100 participants × 4 tests. If room-specific effects are not modeled, could inflate or deflate domain effects. Latin square counterbalancing distributes room effects across participants, but does not REMOVE room-specific variance from domain estimates.
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 4: Analysis Strategy or Section 7: Limitations - Acknowledge that domain effects are estimated across 4 different rooms with potentially different object/location/temporal distinctiveness. Latin square counterbalancing ensures room order is balanced across participants and tests, reducing systematic bias. If room-specific effects are concern, could test whether domain ranking (When > Where > What) holds WITHIN each room separately (though sample size per room may be limited). Alternatively, note that aggregating across rooms INCREASES generalizability of domain effects - if domain differences emerge despite room heterogeneity, suggests robust domain-specific metacognitive patterns."

#### Scoring Summary

**Total Concerns Identified:**
- Commission Errors: 2 (0 CRITICAL, 2 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)
- Omission Errors: 4 (2 CRITICAL, 2 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)
- Alternative Frameworks: 2 (1 CRITICAL, 1 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)
- Methodological Confounds: 2 (0 CRITICAL, 2 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)

**Overall Devil's Advocate Assessment:**

This concept.md demonstrates strong theoretical grounding but has critical omissions regarding practice effects (4-test longitudinal design) and floor effects interpretation (guessing vs monitoring failure). The hypothesis is well-motivated but does not adequately address recent (2020-2024) findings that retrospective confidence is domain-GENERAL (not domain-specific), which challenges the core prediction mechanism. Alternative explanations (task difficulty confound, response bias framework) are not discussed, creating vulnerability to reviewer criticism.

Key strengths include clear quantitative predictions, comprehensive analysis workflow, and explicit hypothesis testing. Key weaknesses include missing engagement with recent metacognition domain-specificity debate and insufficient discussion of methodological confounds (practice effects, encoding quality alternatives).

Recommendations prioritize adding CRITICAL omissions (practice effects discussion, floor effects mechanism distinction) and engaging with domain-generality alternative explanation to strengthen scholarly defensibility.

#### Suggested Improvements (Optional but Recommended)

**1. Add Recent Metacognition Domain-Specificity Literature**

- **Location:** Section 2: Theoretical Background - New paragraph after Consolidation Theory
- **Current:** "[To be added by rq_scholar]" placeholder with no recent citations
- **Suggested:** "Recent metacognition research (Baird et al., 2020) found that retrospective confidence judgments are domain-general, not domain-specific, while only feeling-of-knowing (FOK) showed domain specificity. However, this domain-generality applies to metacognitive BIAS (overall confidence level) rather than metacognitive EFFICIENCY (sensitivity to discriminate correct from incorrect responses). Maniscalco et al. (2016) demonstrated that metacognitive bias is a stable trait-like characteristic with domain-general mechanisms, while metacognitive efficiency relies on domain-specific computations and is performance-dependent. The current RQ tests whether HCE rates (reflecting both bias and efficiency) differ across domains, predicting that floor-level performance in When domain creates domain-specific EFFICIENCY deficits even if overall confidence BIAS is domain-general."
- **Benefit:** Engages with recent (2020) literature, preempts reviewer criticism that confidence is domain-general, and clarifies distinction between bias and efficiency that is central to hypothesis.

---

**2. Distinguish Monitoring Failure vs Guessing Mechanisms for HCE**

- **Location:** Section 2: Hypothesis - New paragraph in Theoretical Rationale subsection
- **Current:** Hypothesis assumes When domain HCE reflects metacognitive failure to adjust confidence for poor memory
- **Suggested:** "When domain floor effects (from Ch5) may produce high HCE rates through two mechanisms: (1) MONITORING FAILURE - memory trace exists but confidence fails to calibrate to weak trace strength, reflecting metacognitive inefficiency; or (2) GUESSING + ARBITRARY CONFIDENCE - no retrievable memory trace, participants guess randomly, and assign confidence based on heuristics (e.g., 'I should express some confidence') rather than memory strength. Both mechanisms produce high-confidence errors, but theoretical implications differ. Monitoring failure suggests domain-specific deficits in accessing temporal memory trace quality; guessing + arbitrary confidence suggests floor performance creates measurement artifact where confidence is disconnected from memory. Analysis will examine confidence distributions within When domain: monitoring failure predicts graded confidence inversely related to accuracy, while guessing predicts uniform or bimodal confidence distribution unrelated to memory strength."
- **Benefit:** Addresses CRITICAL omission identified in devil's advocate analysis, clarifies theoretical interpretation, provides testable distinction between mechanisms.

**3. Acknowledge Practice Effects as Potential Confound**

- **Location:** Section 7: Limitations (create if doesn't exist) or Section 4: Analysis Strategy
- **Current:** No mention of practice effects across 4 test sessions
- **Suggested:** "Participants complete VR memory tests 4 times (Days 0, 1, 3, 6), which may produce practice effects on both accuracy and confidence calibration. Longitudinal memory research demonstrates large practice effects (effect sizes 0.70-0.87; Theisen et al., 1998) with greatest gains at first retest. If practice improves accuracy faster than confidence adjusts upward, HCE rates may decrease over time due to improved calibration rather than memory decay. Conversely, if confidence inflates faster than accuracy improves, HCE rates may increase due to practice-induced overconfidence. The LMM random slopes specification (Time | UID) accounts for individual differences in practice trajectories. If practice effects are domain-general, the Domain × Time interaction tests whether HCE trajectories differ beyond general practice patterns. However, if practice effects differ BY domain (e.g., spatial memory benefits more from repeated testing than temporal memory), could confound interpretation of domain-specific metacognitive patterns."
- **Benefit:** Addresses CRITICAL omission, acknowledges established confound in longitudinal memory research, explains how analysis approach (random slopes) partially mitigates concern.

---

**4. Engage With Task Difficulty Confound Alternative Explanation**

- **Location:** Section 5: Interpretation Guidelines (create if doesn't exist) or Section 2: Theoretical Background
- **Current:** Hypothesis assumes HCE domain differences reflect domain-specific metacognitive access
- **Suggested:** "An alternative explanation is that HCE domain differences reflect task DIFFICULTY rather than domain-specific metacognitive access. Metacognition research shows that metacognitive sensitivity is performance-dependent - the same individual shows greater metacognitive efficiency on easy vs hard tasks (Fleming & Dolan, 2012). When domain floor effects (Ch5) indicate high difficulty, while What/Where domains have moderate difficulty. If metacognitive monitoring is domain-general but applied to domains with different difficulty, would produce HCE pattern (When > Where > What) without domain-specific access. To distinguish these alternatives, analysis tests Domain × Time INTERACTION, not just Domain main effect. If task difficulty alone explains HCE differences, domains should show PARALLEL trajectories over time (all increase as forgetting occurs). Domain × Time interaction tests whether When domain shows ACCELERATING HCE trajectory (difficulty + metacognitive failure to adjust for increasing forgetting) while What/Where show different patterns (stable or decreasing HCE if calibration improves). However, this approach cannot fully deconfound domain-specificity from difficulty without matching baseline performance (empirically impossible given floor effects)."
- **Benefit:** Addresses CRITICAL alternative framework, demonstrates sophisticated understanding of metacognition measurement issues, strengthens interpretation guidelines by clarifying what Domain × Time interaction tests.
