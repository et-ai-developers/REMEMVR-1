RQ 6.3.1 Step 06: Post-Hoc Contrast Decision

Domain × Time Interaction Test:
  - Minimum interaction p-value: 0.1069
  - Threshold: 0.05
  - Result: NOT SIGNIFICANT

Decision: CONTRASTS SKIPPED

Rationale:
  Domain × Time interaction is not significant (p >= 0.05), indicating
  that confidence decline trajectories do NOT differ across episodic memory
  domains. This supports the NULL hypothesis (unitized VR encoding produces
  equivalent forgetting across What/Where/When domains).

  Post-hoc pairwise contrasts are not appropriate when the omnibus interaction
  test is non-significant.

Number of Comparisons: 0 (contrasts not computed)

Result:
  All episodic memory domains show equivalent confidence decline over time.
