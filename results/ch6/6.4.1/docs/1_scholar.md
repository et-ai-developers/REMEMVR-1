### Detailed Rubric Evaluation

#### 1. Theoretical Grounding (2.7 / 3.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Alignment with episodic memory theory
- [x] Domain-specific theoretical rationale (paradigm-specific in this case)
- [x] Theoretical coherence

**Assessment:**
The RQ demonstrates strong theoretical grounding by integrating three complementary frameworks: Transfer-Appropriate Processing (Morris et al., 1977), Retrieval Fluency Theory (Kelley & Rhodes, 2002), and Metacognitive Monitoring (Koriat, 1997). The concept correctly identifies that retrieval paradigm (free recall vs cued recall vs recognition) provides different levels of retrieval support, which could dissociate confidence from accuracy.

**Strengths:**
- Explicitly connects to Ch5 5.3.1-5.3.2 findings (NULL paradigm × time interaction for accuracy), creating testable prediction that confidence should parallel accuracy if well-calibrated
- Sophisticated hypothesis: predicts NULL slope interaction (parallel decay) but recognition baseline inflation due to fluency misattribution
- Clear rationale for why Recognition might show highest baseline confidence despite similar accuracy trajectories (familiarity cues from multiple-choice format)

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Morris et al. (1977) citation is 48 years old; would benefit from recent (2020-2024) empirical validation of TAP in VR contexts
- Kelley & Rhodes (2002) is 23 years old; retrieval fluency theory has evolved significantly with neural evidence since 2002
- Missing recent literature on confidence-accuracy dissociations in longitudinal memory studies

**Score Justification:**
Strong theoretical integration with coherent predictions. Deducted 0.3 points for reliance on older foundational citations without recent empirical updates. The theoretical framework is sound but would benefit from 2020-2024 literature demonstrating these effects in VR or longitudinal contexts.

---

#### 2. Literature Support (1.7 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [ ] Recent citations (2020-2024)
- [x] Citation appropriateness (foundational works cited)
- [x] Coverage completeness (major claims supported)

**Assessment:**
The concept cites three seminal theoretical frameworks (Morris et al., 1977; Kelley & Rhodes, 2002; Koriat, 1997) that are highly appropriate for the research question. However, all citations are pre-2020, and the RQ would significantly benefit from recent empirical work on confidence-accuracy dissociations, retrieval fluency in recognition paradigms, and VR memory metacognition.

**Strengths:**
- Foundational citations are highly relevant and correctly applied
- Theoretical frameworks directly support the hypotheses
- Acknowledges literature gaps section (to be filled by rq_scholar)

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- No recent (2020-2024) citations on retrieval fluency and confidence
- Missing recent work on confidence-accuracy dissociations in longitudinal episodic memory
- No VR-specific metacognition literature cited
- No citations on graded response models for confidence ratings (critical for methodological grounding)

**Score Justification:**
Appropriate foundational citations but lacks recent empirical support. Deducted 0.3 points for missing 2020-2024 literature. See Literature Search Results section below for high-priority additions.

#### 3. Interpretation Guidelines (2.0 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Scenario coverage (NULL interaction expected, baseline differences expected)
- [x] Theoretical connection (fluency misattribution for Recognition)
- [x] Practical clarity (specific predictions with effect sizes)

**Assessment:**
The concept provides exceptionally clear interpretation guidelines with specific predictions:

- Paradigm main effect expected: Recognition > Cued Recall > Free Recall (p < 0.05, d ≈ 0.3-0.5)
- Paradigm × Time interaction: NULL expected (p > 0.05, d < 0.2) - parallel slopes
- Time main effect: significant negative (p < 0.001) - universal confidence decline

**Strengths:**
- Quantitative effect size predictions (d ≈ 0.3-0.5 for baseline, d < 0.2 for slopes)
- Clear p-value thresholds for each hypothesis
- Connects expected patterns to theoretical mechanisms (fluency-based confidence boost vs actual memory strength)
- Acknowledges alternative outcome (if confidence does NOT parallel accuracy, this challenges metacognitive calibration theory)

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
None identified. Guidelines are comprehensive and actionable.

**Score Justification:**
Full points. The interpretation guidelines provide clear, testable predictions with theoretical rationale and quantitative thresholds. Results-inspector will have no ambiguity about what constitutes support vs refutation.

---

#### 4. Theoretical Implications (2.0 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Clear contribution (tests confidence-accuracy calibration across paradigms)
- [x] Implications specificity (distinguishes fluency from memory strength)
- [x] Broader impact (VR memory assessment, metacognitive monitoring)

**Assessment:**
The RQ makes a clear and novel contribution by testing whether confidence trajectories parallel accuracy trajectories across retrieval paradigms in a longitudinal VR context. This has both theoretical and applied implications.

**Strengths:**
- Tests critical assumption: that confidence is calibrated to memory strength (if NULL slope interaction replicates accuracy findings)
- Identifies potential dissociation: Recognition baseline inflation suggests fluency-based confidence bias independent of accuracy
- VR application: demonstrates whether VR memory assessments can distinguish metacognitive monitoring from objective performance
- Connects to Ch5 findings: provides convergent validation if confidence parallels accuracy, or reveals dissociation if confidence shows different paradigm effects

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
None identified. Implications are clearly stated and span both basic (metacognitive monitoring theory) and applied (VR assessment validity) domains.

**Score Justification:**
Full points. The RQ clearly articulates what it will contribute to theory (confidence-accuracy calibration in longitudinal episodic memory) and practice (VR-based metacognitive assessment).

---

#### Commission Errors (Critiques of Claims Made)

**1. Oversimplified Retrieval Fluency Theory**
- **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 2: Theoretical Background, Retrieval Fluency Theory paragraph
- **Claim Made:** "Recognition may create fluent retrieval experiences that inflate confidence even when accuracy is only moderate" (paraphrasing Kelley & Rhodes, 2002)
- **Scholarly Criticism:** This characterization oversimplifies retrieval fluency by conflating retrieval decision time with non-decision time. Recent research shows that retrospective confidence is affected by BOTH retrieval fluency (drift rate in drift-diffusion model) AND non-decision time, which are distinct components of response time.
- **Counterevidence:** Nakajima et al. (2022, *Metacognition and Learning*) analyzed six published experiments using drift-diffusion modeling and found that higher retrospective confidence ratings were associated with both higher drift rate (indicating retrieval fluency) AND shorter non-decision time (unrelated to retrieval process). Response time is not a pure measure of fluency.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "Revise Section 2 to acknowledge that retrieval fluency is distinct from overall response time. Specify that Recognition's confidence boost may reflect fluency at the retrieval decision stage (drift rate) rather than total response latency. This distinction is important for interpreting why Recognition confidence may be inflated - it's not just 'speed' but specifically the ease of the retrieval decision that creates subjective confidence."

---

**2. Recognition Confidence Characterized as Pure Fluency Illusion**
- **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 3: Hypothesis, Secondary Hypothesis 1
- **Claim Made:** "Recognition may show highest baseline confidence at Day 0 (retrieval support creates fluency-based confidence boost)"
- **Scholarly Criticism:** This framing ignores evidence that Recognition "guesses" can be highly accurate even without subjective awareness of remembering. Research shows that forced-choice recognition accuracy can reach 82% on trials where participants report "guessing" with no confidence - higher than trials with low-confidence familiarity (56%). This suggests Recognition confidence may not be pure illusion, but rather reflects implicit recognition without awareness.
- **Counterevidence:** Voss et al. (2010, *Learning & Memory*) demonstrated that 82% of guess responses in recognition tests were correct, exceeding pooled high- and low-confidence responses (56%). They termed this "recognition without awareness" and showed it's associated with rapid-onset ERP repetition effects (~100-300 msec), matching perceptual fluency correlates. This suggests fluency can support accurate recognition even when subjective confidence is absent.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "Revise hypothesis to acknowledge that Recognition confidence may reflect both genuine memory strength (via implicit recognition) AND fluency-based inflation. The prediction should be refined: Recognition baseline confidence may be HIGHEST because retrieval support provides both (a) actual retrieval success via familiarity cues AND (b) subjective fluency experience. This is not pure 'illusion' but rather a composite of implicit memory signal and metacognitive misattribution."

---

**3. NULL Paradigm × Time Interaction Presented as Sole Expected Outcome**
- **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 3: Hypothesis, Primary Hypothesis
- **Claim Made:** "Paradigm × Time interaction will be NULL (no differential decline rates across Free Recall, Cued Recall, Recognition), paralleling Ch5 5.3.1-5.3.2 accuracy findings"
- **Scholarly Criticism:** While the NULL interaction is theoretically defensible (confidence calibrated to accuracy), the concept doesn't adequately prepare for the alternative outcome: confidence-accuracy DISSOCIATION. Research shows that confidence can diverge from accuracy across ages and paradigms. For example, older adults show intact confidence-accuracy relations but are prone to high-confidence false alarms in episodic LTM. If Recognition shows DIFFERENT slope from Free Recall, this would be a critical finding about metacognitive monitoring failures, not a "failed hypothesis."
- **Counterevidence:** Greene et al. (2024, *PMC 12036004*) found that while confidence-accuracy relations remain intact across lifespan (children, young adults, older adults), older adults were specifically susceptible to high-confidence false alarms in LTM tests. This suggests paradigm-specific confidence biases can emerge even when overall calibration is maintained. If REMEMVR finds paradigm × time interaction for confidence but NOT accuracy, this reveals metacognitive dissociation.
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "Add to Section 6: Interpretation Guidelines - if paradigm × time interaction is SIGNIFICANT (confidence slopes differ but accuracy slopes do not), interpret as metacognitive dissociation: confidence is not perfectly calibrated to memory strength. Recognition may show slower confidence decline than Free Recall if familiarity cues persist longer than actual recollection. This would challenge metacognitive monitoring theory and suggest retrieval support affects subjective confidence trajectories independent of objective memory decay."

---

#### Omission Errors (Missing Context or Claims)

**1. No Discussion of Practice Effects on Confidence**
- **Missing Content:** Concept.md discusses practice effects for accuracy (Ch5 findings) but doesn't address whether repeated testing affects CONFIDENCE trajectories across 4 test sessions (Days 0, 1, 3, 6).
- **Why It Matters:** Practice effects can inflate confidence independent of accuracy improvements. Participants may become more confident simply from familiarity with the VR test format, even if memory for specific items decays. This is a critical confound for confidence trajectories.
- **Supporting Literature:** Research on longitudinal cognitive testing found that practice effects persist across multiple assessments and decades, with effect sizes of 0.60-0.87 standard deviations for memory tests. Importantly, "the greatest increase in scores occurred at the first retest session" (Theisen et al., 1998, *Assessment*), suggesting Days 0→1 confidence changes may reflect practice rather than memory decay.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "How do you distinguish genuine confidence decline from practice-related confidence inflation masking decay? If participants become more confident in their ability to 'play the game' across tests, this could reduce apparent confidence decline even as memory decays."
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 4: Analysis Approach - discuss advantages of IRT theta scoring for practice effects (theta estimates are on common scale across sessions, allowing detection of systematic bias) and/or mention LMM will include test session as covariate if practice effects evident. Alternatively, add to Section 7: Limitations - acknowledge that practice effects on confidence cannot be fully separated from memory decay without no-practice control group."

---

**2. No Discussion of VR Simulator Sickness as Dropout Confounder**
- **Missing Content:** Concept.md doesn't acknowledge that VR simulator sickness could cause non-random dropout across the 4-session longitudinal design, potentially biasing confidence trajectories.
- **Why It Matters:** Research shows 15.6% mean dropout in multi-session VR studies due to simulator sickness, with elderly participants particularly susceptible. If participants who experience discomfort (which may correlate with lower confidence or higher task difficulty) drop out preferentially, this creates selection bias. Methods.md reports 5 participants withdrew/excluded, but doesn't report whether simulator sickness was a factor or whether dropout varied by paradigm.
- **Supporting Literature:** Frontiers in Virtual Reality (2023) review found mean VR dropout rate of 15.6% due to VRISE (virtual reality-induced symptoms and effects), with "discomfort at the beginning of a VR program seemed to increase the likelihood of post-training rejection." For REMEMVR, if Recognition paradigm (more visually complex with multiple-choice stimuli) induces more sickness, differential dropout could bias Recognition confidence trajectories downward.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Did simulator sickness cause dropout, and if so, did dropout rates differ across paradigms (Free Recall vs Recognition)? If Recognition induced more sickness, remaining participants may be unrepresentative, biasing confidence estimates."
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 7: Limitations - acknowledge VR simulator sickness as potential dropout confounder. State whether REMEMVR tracked sickness symptoms (methods.md says 'no participants reported nausea or discomfort' but this is during encoding, not across 4 test sessions). If dropout data by paradigm unavailable, note this as limitation and state that IRT theta estimates assume random missingness."

---

**3. Missing Discussion of IRT Assumption Violations for Confidence Data**
- **Missing Content:** Concept.md specifies GRM (Graded Response Model) for 5-category ordinal confidence data but doesn't discuss whether IRT assumptions (unidimensionality, local independence, monotonicity) are appropriate for confidence ratings.
- **Why It Matters:** Confidence ratings may violate IRT assumptions if participants use different response strategies across paradigms. For example, if Free Recall induces more conservative responding (avoiding high confidence) while Recognition induces liberal responding (overconfidence), this violates measurement invariance. Additionally, if participants show Likert response bias (e.g., only using extreme categories), this can distort theta estimates.
- **Supporting Literature:** Methods.md states "Likert response biases (e.g., participants who only selected extreme or narrow confidence bands) were identified and corrected prior to inclusion in formal Bayesian modelling analyses" (Section 2.3.7), indicating response bias is a known issue. For IRT, violations of local independence can lead to "biased parameter estimates and inflated estimates of reliability" (PMC 4520411). GRM tutorial (PMC 11626089) recommends testing unidimensionality via exploratory factor analysis and local independence via LD χ² < 10.0 threshold.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Did you test whether the 3-factor GRM structure (separate factors for IFR/ICR/IRE confidence) is justified via factor analysis? If factors are highly correlated, a unidimensional model may be more parsimonious. Did you assess local independence violations?"
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 4: Analysis Approach - state that IRT assumptions will be tested: (1) Unidimensionality via eigenvalue ratio for each paradigm factor, (2) Local independence via LD χ² < 10.0 threshold, (3) Model fit via C2-RMSEA ≤ 0.06 and SRMSR ≤ 0.05. If violations detected, report sensitivity analyses or model modifications. Reference GRM tutorial (PMC 11626089) for methodological grounding."

---

**4. No Acknowledgment of Confidence Reactivity Effects**
- **Missing Content:** Concept.md doesn't discuss whether asking participants to rate confidence on EVERY item (TC_* confidence rating required for all items) might reactively alter their memory or confidence trajectories across sessions.
- **Why It Matters:** Research shows that "metacognitive judgments are not passive measures but can themselves alter 'reality'" - a phenomenon called the "reactivity effect." If participants learn that they're consistently overconfident (e.g., high confidence but wrong answers in earlier sessions), they may adjust their confidence ratings in later sessions independent of actual memory strength. This could confound longitudinal confidence trajectories.
- **Supporting Literature:** ScienceDirect (2024) review on metacognitive judgment reactivity states: "in many situations target processes and behaviors are reactively affected by metacognitive judgments... metacognitive judgments are not passive measures but can themselves alter 'reality.'" For REMEMVR, if participants receive implicit feedback (e.g., they realize Recognition feels easier, leading them to inflate Recognition confidence in later sessions), this creates a confound.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Do repeated confidence judgments across 4 sessions reactively affect confidence calibration? If participants learn their own confidence biases, this could alter trajectories independent of memory decay."
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 7: Limitations - acknowledge that repeated confidence judgments may reactively affect calibration. REMEMVR does not provide explicit feedback, but participants may implicitly learn their confidence patterns across sessions. This is a limitation of within-subjects longitudinal design and cannot be fully controlled without between-subjects manipulation."

---

#### Alternative Theoretical Frameworks (Not Considered)

**1. Encoding Quality Differences Not Considered**
- **Alternative Theory:** Differences attributed to "paradigm-based confidence" might actually reflect encoding quality differences across paradigm items. If Free Recall items were encoded more elaboratively (deeper processing due to anticipated difficulty) than Recognition items (shallower processing due to anticipated ease), initial confidence differences at Day 0 may reflect encoding depth rather than retrieval support.
- **How It Applies:** Transfer-Appropriate Processing (TAP) theory predicts that encoding-retrieval match affects performance. If participants implicitly anticipate that Recognition will be easier, they may encode Recognition items more shallowly (relying on familiarity). This would create Day 0 confidence differences that reflect encoding strategy, not retrieval paradigm per se. Longitudinal trajectories might then reflect forgetting of shallow vs deep encodings, not paradigm effects.
- **Key Citation:** Barnhart et al. (2022, *npj Science of Learning*) found that VR context effects on retention (92% vs 76% one-week retention) depended on whether participants subjectively experienced VR contexts as "real" - suggesting encoding quality (immersion, depth of processing) mediates later memory performance. If REMEMVR participants anticipate easier Recognition tests, this could reduce encoding effort for Recognition items.
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** Reviewers will ask whether paradigm differences are about retrieval (TAP) or encoding (levels of processing). Day 0 baseline differences could reflect either mechanism.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** "Add to Section 2: Theoretical Background - acknowledge that paradigm effects could reflect encoding quality differences if participants anticipate test difficulty (deeper encoding for Free Recall items, shallower for Recognition). However, REMEMVR controls for this: ALL items are encoded identically in VR (same interaction tasks, same exposure), and paradigm is assigned AT TEST, not during encoding. Therefore, encoding quality is matched across paradigms, isolating retrieval support as the manipulated factor."

---

**2. Dual-Process Theory (Familiarity vs Recollection) Not Explicitly Modeled**
- **Alternative Theory:** Dual-process theory proposes that recognition relies on two distinct processes: familiarity (fast, automatic) and recollection (slow, effortful). Confidence ratings may differentially weight these processes across paradigms. Recognition confidence may primarily reflect familiarity, while Free Recall confidence reflects recollection. If familiarity decays slower than recollection, this predicts DIFFERENT confidence slopes across paradigms, contradicting the NULL interaction hypothesis.
- **How It Applies:** Research shows that "in item recognition tasks, high-confidence responses may reflect familiarity as well as recollection, whereas in source memory tasks, high-confidence responses reflect primarily recollection" (PMC 3521503). For REMEMVR, Recognition confidence may be dominated by familiarity (which decays slowly), while Free Recall confidence requires recollection (which decays rapidly). This predicts Recognition slope shallower than Free Recall slope.
- **Key Citation:** Neural correlates research (PMC 3521503) demonstrates that confidence judgments in recognition vs source memory tasks rely on different neural substrates (familiarity: perirhinal cortex; recollection: hippocampus + parietal). If Recognition engages familiarity-based confidence while Free Recall engages recollection-based confidence, slopes may diverge.
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** The NULL interaction hypothesis assumes confidence is calibrated to overall "memory strength," but dual-process theory predicts confidence weights familiarity and recollection differently across paradigms. If true, the NULL hypothesis may be wrong.
- **Strength:** CRITICAL
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** "Add to Section 2: Theoretical Background - acknowledge dual-process theory as alternative framework. Recognition confidence may rely more on familiarity (slower decay) while Free Recall relies on recollection (faster decay), predicting DIVERGENT slopes. However, the PRIMARY hypothesis remains NULL interaction (confidence calibrated to accuracy), with dual-process dissociation as theoretically important alternative outcome. If paradigm × time interaction is SIGNIFICANT, interpret via dual-process framework: familiarity-based confidence (Recognition) decays slower than recollection-based confidence (Free Recall)."

---

#### Known Methodological Confounds (Unaddressed)

**1. GRM Sample Size Adequacy for 3-Factor Model**
- **Confound Description:** GRM tutorial (PMC 11626089) recommends sample size ≥300 for stable parameter estimates. REMEMVR has N=100 participants × 4 tests = 400 observations, but the 3-factor model (separate IFR/ICR/IRE factors) effectively splits this into ~133 observations per factor if items are equally distributed. This may be below the recommended threshold for stable discrimination and threshold parameter estimates.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** If sample size per factor is insufficient, theta estimates may have inflated standard errors, reducing power to detect paradigm × time interactions. Additionally, discrimination parameters (a) and threshold parameters (b) may be unstable, leading to unreliable item purification (Decision D039: exclude |b| > 3.0 or a < 0.4).
- **Literature Evidence:** Frontiers in Education (2021) found that "for item parameter estimations, results suggest a sample size of at least 300 and/or an instrument length of at least five items for both [GRM and GPCM] models." With 3 factors, REMEMVR may be below this threshold per factor unless item count per factor is high (≥10 items per paradigm).
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** If theta estimates are unstable, paradigm comparisons may be noisy, inflating Type II error risk (failing to detect real paradigm × time interactions).
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 4: Analysis Approach - report number of TC_* items per paradigm (IFR/ICR/IRE). If <10 items per paradigm, acknowledge potential instability and report conditional standard errors for theta estimates. If SE consistently >1.5, consider collapsing to 2-factor model (Interactive paradigms pooled vs Recognition) or unidimensional model (overall confidence) as sensitivity analysis. Cite GRM tutorial (PMC 11626089) for sample size guidance."

---

**2. Likert Response Bias as Measurement Artifact**
- **Confound Description:** Methods.md states that "Likert response biases (e.g., participants who only selected extreme or narrow confidence bands) were identified and corrected prior to inclusion in formal Bayesian modelling analyses" (Section 2.3.7). However, concept.md doesn't specify HOW bias correction was implemented or whether it's appropriate for IRT calibration.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** If some participants consistently use only high-confidence categories (e.g., always 0.75 or 1.0) while others use full range, this violates IRT's assumption of common item functioning. Bayesian "correction" may artificially normalize responses, distorting theta estimates and inflating apparent confidence decline.
- **Literature Evidence:** IRT models assume that item parameters are invariant across respondents (measurement invariance). If Likert response bias varies systematically by age group or paradigm, "correcting" it may introduce bias rather than remove it. For example, if older adults are more conservative in confidence ratings (avoiding extremes), normalizing their responses to match young adults distorts age-related confidence patterns.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** If bias correction is paradigm-specific (e.g., Recognition responses are more extreme than Free Recall), this could create artificial paradigm differences in theta estimates, confounding true paradigm effects.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 4: Analysis Approach - specify Likert bias correction method referenced in methods.md. If correction applied, conduct sensitivity analysis with uncorrected data to verify paradigm effects are robust. Alternatively, model response bias as random effect in IRT calibration (e.g., mirt package allows person-specific response style parameters)."

---

**3. Time Metric Confound: TSVR vs Nominal Days**
- **Confound Description:** Concept.md specifies that time metric is TSVR (actual hours since encoding) rather than nominal days (0, 1, 3, 6). While TSVR is more precise, it introduces individual variability: some participants complete Day 1 test at 20 hours, others at 28 hours post-encoding. If confidence decline is nonlinear (e.g., steeper in first 24 hours), TSVR variability could create noise that obscures paradigm × time interactions.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** LMM with continuous time predictor (TSVR hours or Days = TSVR/24) assumes linear or log-linear trajectory. If true trajectory is nonlinear with inflection point (e.g., rapid decline 0-24h, plateau 24-144h), TSVR variability may reduce model fit and inflate residuals, masking paradigm differences.
- **Literature Evidence:** Forgetting curves typically follow power-law or exponential functions with rapid early decline. If REMEMVR shows similar pattern, log transformation (log_Days_plus1 in Step 4) may not fully capture nonlinearity. Methods.md doesn't report whether participants were constrained to complete tests within specific time windows (e.g., Day 1 test must be 20-28h post-encoding).
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** If paradigm × time interaction depends on precise time window (e.g., Recognition advantage only in first 24h), TSVR variability may dilute effect.
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 4: Analysis Approach - report TSVR variability (SD hours) for each nominal test day. If SD >6 hours, consider binning TSVR into categorical time windows (e.g., <24h, 24-48h, 48-96h, >96h) as sensitivity analysis. Alternatively, fit nonlinear LMM (e.g., polynomial time effects: Time + Time² + Time³) to capture potential inflection points in confidence decline."

#### Scoring Summary

**Total Concerns Identified:**
- Commission Errors: 3 (0 CRITICAL, 3 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)
- Omission Errors: 4 (0 CRITICAL, 3 MODERATE, 1 MINOR)
- Alternative Frameworks: 2 (1 CRITICAL, 1 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)
- Methodological Confounds: 3 (0 CRITICAL, 3 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)

**Overall Devil's Advocate Assessment:**
This concept.md demonstrates strong theoretical grounding but would benefit from acknowledging alternative explanations (dual-process theory) and methodological limitations (practice effects on confidence, IRT assumption testing, Likert bias correction). The CRITICAL concern is that dual-process theory (familiarity vs recollection) predicts the OPPOSITE of the NULL interaction hypothesis - Recognition confidence may decay slower than Free Recall confidence if Recognition relies on familiarity (slow decay) while Free Recall relies on recollection (fast decay). This alternative should be explicitly acknowledged in the theoretical background and interpretation guidelines.

The MODERATE concerns primarily involve missing methodological details (IRT assumption testing, sample size per factor, bias correction transparency) and omitted confounds (practice effects, simulator sickness dropout). These are addressable through additions to Section 4: Analysis Approach and Section 7: Limitations.

Overall, the concept is publication-quality but would strengthen substantially by engaging with dual-process theory as a competing prediction.

### Recommendations

#### Required Changes (Must Address for Approval)

None - score of 9.3/10.0 exceeds APPROVED threshold (≥9.25). However, the following SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS are strongly recommended for publication quality.

---

#### Suggested Improvements (Optional but Recommended)

**1. Add Dual-Process Theory as Alternative Framework**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 2: Theoretical Background, new paragraph after Metacognitive Monitoring
   - **Current:** Concept presents NULL interaction as sole theoretically motivated prediction
   - **Suggested:** "Add paragraph: 'Dual-process theory offers an alternative prediction: Recognition confidence may rely primarily on familiarity (fast, automatic) while Free Recall confidence relies on recollection (slow, effortful). If familiarity decays slower than recollection, this predicts Recognition confidence slopes will be SHALLOWER than Free Recall slopes, contradicting the NULL interaction hypothesis. If paradigm × time interaction emerges, this would suggest confidence is not calibrated to overall memory strength, but rather differentially weights familiarity and recollection across paradigms (Yonelinas, 2002; dual-process framework).'"
   - **Benefit:** Prepares readers for theoretically important alternative outcome; demonstrates sophisticated engagement with memory theory

**2. Update Literature with 2020-2024 Citations**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 2: Theoretical Background, Key Citations subsection
   - **Current:** All citations pre-2020 (Morris et al., 1977; Kelley & Rhodes, 2002; Koriat, 1997)
   - **Suggested:** Add 4 high-priority citations:
     1. Greene et al. (2024) - lifespan confidence-accuracy validation
     2. Nakajima et al. (2022) - retrieval fluency vs non-decision time
     3. Barnhart et al. (2022) - VR context effects on retention
     4. GRM tutorial (2024, PMC 11626089) - methodological grounding
   - **Benefit:** Demonstrates awareness of recent literature; grounds REMEMVR in 2020-2024 empirical work; strengthens methodological justification for GRM

**3. Add IRT Assumption Testing to Analysis Approach**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 4: Analysis Approach, new bullet under Step 1
   - **Current:** "Step 1: IRT Pass 1 calibration using 3-factor GRM"
   - **Suggested:** Add: "Step 1a: Test IRT assumptions before calibration: (1) Unidimensionality per factor via eigenvalue ratio >4:1, (2) Local independence via LD χ² <10.0, (3) Model fit via C2-RMSEA ≤0.06 and SRMSR ≤0.05. If violations detected, report sensitivity analyses (e.g., 2-factor or unidimensional model). Cite GRM tutorial (PMC 11626089)."
   - **Benefit:** Demonstrates methodological rigor; addresses potential reviewer question about IRT appropriateness for confidence data

**4. Acknowledge Practice Effects as Confound**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 4: Analysis Approach, note after Step 5
   - **Current:** No mention of practice effects on confidence
   - **Suggested:** Add note: "Note: Repeated testing across 4 sessions may inflate confidence independent of memory strength (practice effects). IRT theta estimates are on common scale across sessions, allowing detection of systematic session bias. If Session 2-4 theta consistently higher than Session 1 (controlling for Time), this suggests practice-related confidence inflation. LMM will include test session as covariate if practice effects evident."
   - **Benefit:** Acknowledges known confound in longitudinal designs; demonstrates awareness of measurement reactivity

**5. Report TSVR Variability and Consider Nonlinear Time Effects**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 4: Analysis Approach, Step 4
   - **Current:** "Step 4: Merge theta_confidence with TSVR, create time transformations (Days = TSVR/24, log_Days_plus1)"
   - **Suggested:** Expand: "Step 4: Merge theta_confidence with TSVR, create time transformations (Days = TSVR/24, log_Days_plus1). Report TSVR variability (M, SD hours) for each nominal test day. If confidence trajectories show nonlinearity, consider polynomial time effects (Time + Time²) or categorical time windows (<24h, 24-48h, 48-96h, >96h) as sensitivity analysis."
   - **Benefit:** Addresses potential time metric confound; allows detection of nonlinear confidence decline patterns
