RQ 6.3.1 Step 06: Post-Hoc Contrast Decision

Domain × Time Interaction Test:
  - Minimum interaction p-value: 0.0202
  - Threshold: 0.05
  - Result: SIGNIFICANT

Decision: CONTRASTS COMPUTED

Rationale:
  Domain × Time interaction is significant (p < 0.05), indicating
  that confidence decline trajectories differ across episodic memory
  domains. Post-hoc pairwise contrasts are appropriate to identify
  which specific domains differ.

Number of Comparisons: 3
  1. When vs What
  2. Where vs What
  3. When vs Where

Multiple Comparison Correction (Decision D068):
  - Method: Bonferroni
  - Family-wise alpha: 0.05
  - Per-comparison alpha: 0.0167 (0.05/3)
  - Dual p-values reported: uncorrected AND Bonferroni-corrected

Significant Contrasts (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05):
  - When vs What: estimate=-0.0253, p=0.0193
  - When vs Where: estimate=-0.0242, p=0.0279
