## 1. Statistical Findings

### Sample Characteristics

- **Total N:** 100 participants x 4 test sessions x 3 domains = 1200 observations
- **Test sessions:** T1, T2, T3, T4 (nominal Days 0, 1, 3, 6)
- **Time variable:** TSVR (actual hours since encoding: 1, 28.8, 78.7, 151.4 hours per Decision D070)
- **Missing data:** None (all participants completed all 4 sessions)
- **Exclusions:** None at participant level

### IRT Calibration Results

**Pass 1 Calibration (All Items):**
- **Model:** Graded Response Model (GRM) 3-factor (What/Where/When)
- **Items analyzed:** 102 TC_* confidence items (5-category ordinal: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0)
- **Domain breakdown:** What: 18 items, Where: 36 items, When: 48 items (pre-purification)
- **Convergence:** Successful with minimal settings (mc_samples=1, iw_samples=100)

**Item Purification (Decision D039):**
- **Criteria:** Discrimination a >= 0.4, Difficulty |b| <= 3.0
- **Items retained:** 72/102 (70.6%)
- **Domain retention:**
  - What: 18/18 items (100% retention)
  - Where: 36/36 items (100% retention)
  - When: 18/48 items (37.5% retention - 30 temporal items excluded for extreme difficulty)
- **All domains >= 10 items:** 3-factor model retained (no domain exclusion needed)

**Pass 2 Calibration (Purified Items):**
- **Items:** 72 purified items
- **Model:** GRM 3-factor, 5 categories
- **Convergence:** Successful
- **Item parameters:**
  - Discrimination (a): Range [2.066, 5.816], all above 0.4 threshold
  - Difficulty (b): Range [-0.007, 1.117], all within [-3, 3] bounds
- **Theta estimates:**
  - Range: [-2.338, 0.633]
  - Standard errors: Within [0.1, 1.5] acceptable range
  - N = 400 composite_IDs (100 participants x 4 tests)

### Longitudinal Trajectory Analysis

**Linear Mixed Model:**
- **Outcome:** Theta confidence scores (latent confidence ability, domain-specific)
- **Fixed effects:** Domain * log_TSVR interaction
- **Random effects:** Random intercept per participant (simplified from planned random slopes due to convergence)
- **Time variable:** log_TSVR (log-transformed hours since encoding)
- **Model fit:** AIC = 506.19, BIC = 546.91, converged successfully

**Fixed Effect Estimates:**

| Effect | Coefficient | SE | p (uncorrected) | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----|-----------------|-----------------|
| Intercept (What baseline) | -0.358 | 0.033 | <.0001 | What domain baseline confidence at T1 |
| Domain[When] | +0.077 | 0.040 | .0596 | When starts marginally higher than What (n.s.) |
| Domain[Where] | -0.029 | 0.040 | .4831 | Where similar to What at baseline (n.s.) |
| log_TSVR (Time) | -0.118 | 0.011 | <.0001 | **Significant decline** across all domains |
| Domain[When] x Time | -0.025 | 0.011 | .0202 | **When declines FASTER** than What (significant) |
| Domain[Where] x Time | -0.001 | 0.011 | .9159 | Where decline same as What (n.s.) |

**Key Finding:** Significant When x Time interaction (p = .0202) indicates **temporal confidence declines faster** than object confidence, rejecting NULL hypothesis of domain-invariant trajectories.

### Post-Hoc Contrasts (Decision D068 Dual P-Values)

| Contrast | Estimate | SE | t | p (uncorr) | p (Bonf) | Cohen's d |
|----------|----------|----|----|------------|----------|-----------|
| When vs What | -0.025 | 0.009 | -2.72 | .0064 | **.0193** | -0.116 |
| Where vs What | -0.001 | 0.009 | -0.12 | .9014 | 1.000 | -0.005 |
| When vs Where | -0.024 | 0.009 | -2.60 | .0093 | **.0279** | -0.111 |

**Interpretation:** When domain shows significantly faster confidence decline than both What and Where domains after Bonferroni correction. Where and What trajectories do not differ significantly.

### Extended Model Comparison (Kitchen Sink Approach)

- **Best model:** Ultimate (complex polynomial with multiple transformations)
  - AIC = 299.94
  - Akaike weight = 55.6% (moderate uncertainty)
- **Log model:** Ranked #45 out of 65 models
  - ”AIC = 19.29 from best model (substantial evidence against simple log)
- **Top 10 models:** All involve power law, polynomial, or complex transformations
- **Interpretation:** Confidence decline trajectory is MORE COMPLEX than simple logarithmic decay, supporting sophisticated forgetting dynamics

## 2. Plot Descriptions

### Figure 1: Confidence Trajectory - Theta Scale

**Filename:** `plots/trajectory_theta.png`
**Plot Type:** Line plot with confidence bands (theta scale)
**Generated By:** Step 7 plotting (rq_plots agent)

**Visual Description:**

The plot displays confidence ability trajectories across 4 test sessions (T1 ~1 hour, T2 ~29 hours, T3 ~79 hours, T4 ~151 hours) for three memory domains on the theta scale:

- **X-axis:** Hours Since VR Encoding (TSVR, log scale for visualization)
- **Y-axis:** Theta confidence scores (latent ability, standardized): -1.5 to 0.5
- **Three domain trajectories:**
  - **What (red):** ¸ = -0.47 (T1) -> -1.02 (T4), decline = 0.55 SD
  - **When (green):** ¸ = -0.39 (T1) -> -1.03 (T4), decline = 0.64 SD
  - **Where (blue):** ¸ = -0.49 (T1) -> -1.04 (T4), decline = 0.55 SD

**Key Patterns:**

1. **All domains show monotonic decline** (confidence decreases over 6-day retention)
2. **Baseline differences modest:** When starts marginally higher (¸ = -0.39 vs -0.47/-0.49), but NOT significant (p = .0596)
3. **When domain shows STEEPER decline** (0.64 SD vs 0.55 SD), visually evident in plot divergence
4. **Confidence bands (95% CI) narrow throughout** - high precision in estimates
5. **All trajectories converge near ¸ = -1.0** at Day 6 (floor effect emerging)

**Connection to Findings:**

- Visual confirms significant When x Time interaction (² = -0.025, p = .0202)
- Steeper When trajectory matches post-hoc contrasts (When vs What/Where: p < .05 Bonferroni)
- Where and What trajectories nearly parallel, consistent with non-significant Where x Time interaction (p = .9159)

---

### Figure 2: Confidence Trajectory - Probability Scale (D069)

**Filename:** `plots/trajectory_probability.png`
**Plot Type:** Line plot with confidence bands (probability scale, Decision D069 dual-scale compliance)
**Generated By:** Step 7 plotting (rq_plots agent)

**Visual Description:**

The plot displays the same trajectories transformed to probability scale (0-100%) for non-psychometrician interpretability:

- **X-axis:** Hours Since VR Encoding (TSVR)
- **Y-axis:** Probability Correct (%): 0 to 100%
- **Three domain trajectories:**
  - **What:** 14% (T1) -> 2% (T4), decline = 12 percentage points
  - **When:** 20% (T1) -> 3% (T4), decline = 17 percentage points
  - **Where:** 12% (T1) -> 2% (T4), decline = 10 percentage points

**Key Patterns:**

1. **Extreme floor effects:** ALL probabilities <25% throughout retention interval
2. **All domains converge near 0% by Day 6** (practical floor)
3. **When shows steepest decline** (17 pp vs 12/10 pp), consistent with theta findings
4. **Probability scale interpretation LIMITED** due to extreme floor effects (see Limitations section)

**Connection to Findings:**

- Probability scale confirms When domain's faster decline (steeper slope)
- However, probabilities near floor (all <25%, approaching 0%) suggest **transformation may not be meaningful** for confidence data with extreme negative theta values
- Decision D069 dual-scale reporting intent (practical interpretability) is COMPROMISED by floor effects

---

## 3. Interpretation

### Hypothesis Testing

**Original Hypothesis (from 1_concept.md):**

NULL hypothesis expected: "Domain x Time interaction will be non-significant (p > 0.05), replicating Ch5 5.2.1 accuracy findings where unitized VR encoding eliminated domain separations."

**Hypothesis Status:** **REJECTED**

The statistical findings **refute the NULL hypothesis:**
- When x Time interaction: ² = -0.025, p = .0202 (significant)
- Post-hoc contrasts: When vs What/Where both significant after Bonferroni correction
- Effect size: Small (Cohen's d ~ -0.11) but consistent

**Theoretical Implication:** Confidence trajectories show domain-SPECIFIC patterns, diverging from Ch5 5.2.1 accuracy findings where domain x time interaction was NULL. This suggests **metacognitive monitoring (confidence) does NOT parallel objective performance (accuracy)** in VR episodic memory.

### Domain-Specific Insights

**What Domain (Object Confidence):**
- **Trajectory:** Moderate decline (0.55 SD over 6 days, 14% -> 2% probability)
- **Baseline:** Lowest initial confidence (¸ = -0.47) among domains
- **Interpretation:** Object identification confidence remains relatively stable compared to temporal domain, consistent with What domain's relatively preserved accuracy in Ch5 findings

**Where Domain (Spatial Confidence):**
- **Trajectory:** Moderate decline (0.55 SD over 6 days, 12% -> 2% probability), parallel to What
- **Baseline:** Similar to What (¸ = -0.49, no significant difference)
- **Interpretation:** Spatial confidence trajectory identical to object confidence. This parallels Ch5 5.2.1 finding where Where accuracy was NOT significantly different from What over time (both domains showed similar forgetting rates). Confidence tracks accuracy pattern for spatial domain.

**When Domain (Temporal Confidence):**
- **Trajectory:** FASTEST decline (0.64 SD over 6 days, 20% -> 3% probability)
- **Baseline:** Marginally higher than What/Where (¸ = -0.39, p = .0596), possibly reflecting **overconfidence**
- **Critical Finding:** When confidence declines FASTER despite starting HIGHER
- **Interpretation:** Temporal confidence shows accelerated decay NOT observed in Where domain. This could reflect:
  1. **Metacognitive awareness of temporal memory weakness** - participants recognize temporal order is hardest to recall
  2. **Item purification artifact** - 30/48 When items excluded (63% exclusion) leaves only "easy" temporal items, but confidence still drops fastest
  3. **Floor effects in Ch5 accuracy** - When domain showed lowest accuracy in Ch5, confidence may belatedly track this poor performance (delayed metacognitive insight)

### Unexpected Pattern: Confidence-Accuracy Divergence

**Ch5 5.2.1 Accuracy Findings (Reference):**
- Domain x Time interaction: NULL (p > .05)
- Interpretation: Unitized VR encoding eliminated traditional WWW domain separations
- What/Where/When showed parallel forgetting trajectories

**This RQ (6.3.1) Confidence Findings:**
- Domain x Time interaction: SIGNIFICANT (p = .0202)
- When domain declines faster than What/Where
- Confidence trajectories are domain-SPECIFIC, not parallel

**Divergence Interpretation:**

The **mismatch between confidence and accuracy domain patterns** suggests:

1. **Metacognitive Monitoring is NOT Perfectly Calibrated:** Participants' subjective confidence judgments do not perfectly track their objective performance patterns. While accuracy shows domain-invariant forgetting (Ch5), confidence shows domain-specific decline with temporal confidence deteriorating fastest.

2. **When Domain Metacognitive Deficit:** Temporal memory may suffer from a **dual deficit**: both poor accuracy (Ch5 floor effects) AND poor confidence calibration (this RQ's faster decline). Participants may lack insight into how badly their temporal memory is performing, initially showing overconfidence (marginally higher baseline) followed by accelerated decline as errors accumulate.

3. **Potential Alternative:** If Ch5 5.2.1 data show When domain WAS significantly worse for accuracy but analysis didn't detect it (power issue), then confidence is CORRECTLY tracking poorer temporal performance. However, status.yaml context from Ch5 5.2.1 indicates domain x time interaction was NULL, suggesting confidence is showing a pattern NOT evident in accuracy.

### Broader Implications

**REMEMVR Validation:**

Mixed evidence for validity:
- **Positive:** Confidence measures show sensitivity to temporal memory (When domain shows distinct pattern)
- **Concern:** Confidence-accuracy divergence raises calibration questions - are confidence ratings measuring subjective feelings or actual performance?

**Methodological Insights:**

1. **IRT Purification Critical (Decision D039):**
   - 30/48 When items excluded (63%) vs 0% What/Where exclusions
   - Temporal confidence items had extreme difficulty (b > 3.0), suggesting measurement issues
   - Future test development: Pilot test temporal confidence items more carefully

2. **Extended Model Comparison Valuable:**
   - Kitchen sink approach identified "Ultimate" complex model (AIC=299.94)
   - Simple log model ranked #45 (”AIC=19.29) - substantial evidence against
   - Confidence trajectories follow MORE COMPLEX forgetting dynamics than accuracy

3. **Dual-Scale Reporting Limited by Floor Effects (Decision D069):**
   - Probability scale intent: Make findings accessible to non-psychometricians
   - Reality: Probabilities <25% throughout, approaching 0% by Day 6
   - **Recommendation:** Decision D069 dual-scale reporting appropriate for ACCURACY data (Ch5), but questionable for CONFIDENCE data with extreme negative theta values

**Clinical Relevance:**

For cognitive assessment applications:
- **Confidence ratings may NOT substitute for accuracy measures:** Divergence between confidence and accuracy domain patterns suggests they tap different constructs
- **Temporal metacognition particularly vulnerable:** When domain's faster confidence decline suggests temporal memory monitoring is fragile
- **Floor effects limit utility:** Confidence probabilities <25% provide little diagnostic information (all participants performing near floor)

---

## 4. Limitations

### Sample Limitations

**Sample Size:**
- N = 100 participants adequate for detecting medium effects (power ~ 0.80 for d = 0.50) but underpowered for small effects
- When x Time interaction effect small (Cohen's d ~ -0.11), detected but CIs wide
- Domain contrasts similarly small effects, limiting precision

**Demographic Constraints:**
- University undergraduate sample (age M ~ 20) limits generalizability to older adults
- All participants cognitively healthy - cannot generalize to clinical populations (MCI, dementia)
- Sample demographics not reported in logs (ethnicity, education years, etc.)

**Attrition:**
- None reported (all 100 participants completed all 4 sessions)
- Unusually low attrition for 6-day retention study - possible selection effect (highly motivated participants)

### Methodological Limitations

**Measurement:**

1. **Confidence vs Accuracy Construct Validity:**
   - TC_* confidence items (5-category Likert: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0) measure SUBJECTIVE confidence, not objective performance
   - IRT transformation assumes confidence maps to "probability correct," but these are distinct constructs
   - Divergence from Ch5 accuracy findings questions whether confidence validly reflects memory strength

2. **Extreme Floor Effects:**
   - All domains show theta < 0 throughout retention (no positive theta values)
   - Probability transformation yields <25% "correct" probabilities, approaching 0% by Day 6
   - Floor effects suggest confidence ratings lack sensitivity at low performance levels OR participants systematically underconfident

3. **Item Purification Imbalance:**
   - When domain: 63% exclusion rate (30/48 items removed)
   - What/Where: 0% exclusion (all items retained)
   - Imbalanced purification may create artificial domain differences (When items only the "easy" subset, yet still decline fastest)

4. **Response Pattern Limitations (per solution.md section 1.4):**
   - **Confidence rating response patterns NOT documented:** % participants using full 1-5 range vs extremes only (1s and 5s) unknown
   - **No bias correction applied** (transparency priority per D068 philosophy)
   - **Interpretability concern:** If participants predominantly use extreme responses (1 or 5 only), ordinal GRM assumptions may be violated (requires full scale usage)
   - **Recommendation for future analyses:** Document response pattern distributions and consider bias correction if extreme response style prevalent

**Design:**

1. **No Control Condition:**
   - Cannot isolate VR-specific confidence effects (no 2D comparison condition)
   - Confidence decline may differ in non-VR episodic tasks
   - Cannot determine if domain differences are VR-specific or general episodic memory pattern

2. **Test Session Timing:**
   - Fixed retention intervals (nominal Days 0, 1, 3, 6) may miss critical forgetting dynamics
   - Day 6 insufficient to observe asymptotic forgetting (all domains still declining)
   - No immediate post-encoding baseline (Day 0 is encoding, T1 is first retrieval at ~1 hour)

3. **Practice Effects:**
   - Four repeated confidence ratings may alter confidence trajectory (testing effect)
   - Participants may learn to calibrate confidence based on feedback from prior retrievals
   - No way to separate forgetting from practice/calibration effects with current design

**Statistical:**

1. **LMM Specification:**
   - Simplified to random intercept only (planned random slopes caused convergence issues)
   - Cannot model individual differences in confidence decline rates
   - Fixed effects only for Domain (no random Domain effects), limiting individual difference modeling

2. **IRT Model:**
   - GRM assumes monotonic item response functions (may not hold for confidence ratings where overconfidence can reverse monotonicity)
   - 3-factor structure assumed (not compared against 1D, 2D, or 4D+ alternatives)
   - Local independence assumption may be violated for semantically related items

3. **Multiple Comparisons:**
   - Bonferroni correction conservative (may miss true effects with p = .01-.05)
   - 65 models tested in kitchen sink comparison (multiple comparison issue not addressed)
   - No pre-registered analysis plan (exploratory analyses risk Type I error inflation)

### Generalizability Constraints

**Population:**
- Findings may not generalize to:
  - Older adults (age-related metacognitive monitoring changes)
  - Clinical populations (MCI, dementia - confidence-accuracy dissociations common in neurological disorders)
  - Children/adolescents (developing metacognitive monitoring)
  - Non-WEIRD samples (cultural differences in confidence expression)

**Context:**
- VR desktop paradigm differs from:
  - Fully immersive HMD VR (greater presence may enhance confidence monitoring)
  - Real-world episodic memory (naturalistic encoding contexts)
  - Standard neuropsychological tests (2D stimuli, verbal confidence ratings)

**Task:**
- REMEMVR confidence ratings (TC_* items) may not reflect:
  - Naturalistic confidence judgments (spontaneous, not prompted)
  - Emotional episodic memories (neutral VR content, no affective salience)
  - Real-world metacognitive monitoring (consequential decisions based on confidence)

### Technical Limitations

**IRT Purification Impact (Decision D039):**
- **When domain: 63% item exclusion** raises concerns:
  - Information loss (30/48 items removed, leaving only 18)
  - Domain imbalance (What/Where: 0% exclusion, When: 63% exclusion)
  - Generalizability to full When item set uncertain (retained items may be "easy subset")
  - **Critical:** Temporal confidence items fundamentally problematic (extreme difficulty b > 3.0 for excluded items)

**Dual-Scale Transformation Issues (Decision D069):**

1. **2PL vs GRM Mismatch:**
   - **ANOMALY IDENTIFIED:** Probability scale shows When starting HIGHER (20%) despite theta starting LOWER (¸ = -0.39 vs -0.47 for What). This CONTRADICTS expected IRT relationship (higher theta = higher probability).
   - **Root Cause:** GRM uses category-specific thresholds (b1, b2, b3, b4 for 5-category model), NOT single difficulty parameter like 2PL. Transformation formula in plots may use 2PL approximation (single b), which doesn't accurately represent GRM ordinal structure.
   - **Investigation Needed:** Clarify whether probability transformation uses GRM category averaging or 2PL simplification. If 2PL, transformation is INVALID for GRM data.

2. **Extreme Negative Theta Values:**
   - All theta < 0 throughout retention interval (range [-2.3, +0.6], heavily negative-skewed)
   - IRT probability transformation P(correct) = 1 / (1 + exp(-(a*(¸ - b)))) yields probabilities <25% for ¸ < -0.5
   - When ¸ approaches -2.0, probabilities approach 0% (floor effect)
   - **Conclusion:** Probability scale provides minimal additional information beyond "very low confidence throughout"

3. **Confidence vs Accuracy Interpretation:**
   - Decision D069 designed for ACCURACY data (TQ_* items in Ch5) where "probability correct" is meaningful
   - For CONFIDENCE data (TC_* items), "probability" is ambiguous: Probability of what? Correct confidence judgment? Actual performance probability given confidence rating?
   - **Recommendation:** Decision D069 dual-scale reporting should be CONDITIONAL: Apply to accuracy trajectories (Ch5), but QUESTION applicability to confidence trajectories (Ch6) where construct validity unclear

**Kitchen Sink Model Comparison:**
- 65 models tested without multiple comparison correction (inflates Type I error risk)
- Best model "Ultimate" (AIC=299.94, weight=55.6%) indicates MODERATE uncertainty, not strong support
- Top models involve complex transformations (power laws, polynomials) - may overfit with 1200 observations
- Simple log model ranked #45 suggests trajectory is complex, but which complex form is optimal remains uncertain

### Limitations Summary

Despite these constraints, findings are **scientifically interpretable within scope:**
- When domain's faster confidence decline is robust across analytical approaches (LMM, contrasts, plots)
- Effect sizes small but consistent (Cohen's d ~ -0.11)
- **Critical caveat:** Confidence-accuracy divergence (this RQ vs Ch5 5.2.1) suggests metacognitive monitoring operates independently of objective performance, raising validity questions

**Automated Pipeline Transparency:** This analysis used automated pipeline (13 agents, v4.X architecture). Results validated for technical correctness (rq_inspect) and scientific plausibility (rq_results). Anomalies flagged above require manual expert review before publication.

## 5. Next Steps

### Immediate Follow-Ups (Current Data)

**1. Clarify IRT Probability Transformation for GRM Models:**
- **Why:** Anomaly identified where When domain shows HIGHER probability despite LOWER theta (contradicts IRT theory)
- **How:** Review plots.py transformation formula - does it use 2PL approximation (invalid for GRM) or GRM category averaging?
- **Expected Insight:** Determine if probability scale is mathematically valid for GRM ordinal data or requires correction
- **Timeline:** Immediate (code review, no re-analysis needed)

**2. Compare to Ch5 5.2.1 Accuracy Domain Analysis:**
- **Why:** Step 8 deferred - need formal comparison of confidence vs accuracy domain patterns
- **How:** Extract Ch5 5.2.1 Domain x Time interaction p-value, create comparison table per plan.md Step 8 specification
- **Expected Insight:** Quantify magnitude of confidence-accuracy divergence, test whether Ch5 interaction was truly NULL or underpowered
- **Timeline:** 1-2 hours (requires reading Ch5 5.2.1 results/summary.md)

**3. Document Confidence Response Patterns:**
- **Why:** Solution.md section 1.4 requires documenting % participants using full 1-5 range vs extremes only
- **How:** Analyze step00_irt_input.csv response distributions, compute % extreme responses (1 or 5 only), % mid-scale (2-4)
- **Expected Insight:** Determine if extreme response style violates GRM assumptions (requires full scale usage)
- **Timeline:** 1 hour (descriptive statistics on raw TC_* item responses)

### Planned Thesis RQs (Chapter 6 Continuation)

**RQ 6.3.2: Domain Confidence Calibration (Planned):**
- **Focus:** Compare confidence ratings (this RQ) to actual accuracy (Ch5 5.2.X) to compute calibration metrics
- **Why:** Confidence-accuracy divergence identified in this RQ requires formal calibration analysis
- **Builds On:** Uses theta_confidence from this RQ (step03_theta_long.csv), merges with Ch5 accuracy theta estimates
- **Expected Calibration Metrics:** Brier score, over/underconfidence index, resolution
- **Expected Timeline:** Next RQ in Chapter 6 confidence analysis sequence

**RQ 6.3.3: Individual Differences in Confidence Trajectories (Exploratory):**
- **Focus:** Extract participant-specific confidence slopes, cluster "optimistic" vs "pessimistic" confidence responders
- **Why:** LMM simplified to random intercept only (no random slopes due to convergence), but individual differences in confidence decline may be theoretically important
- **Builds On:** Re-fit LMM with random slopes (accept convergence issues), extract BLUPs for clustering
- **Expected Timeline:** Two RQs ahead (after calibration analysis)

### Methodological Extensions (Future Data Collection)

**1. Test Alternative IRT Dimensionality:**
- **Current Limitation:** 3 dimensions (What/Where/When) assumed, not empirically validated
- **Extension:** Fit 1D, 2D, 4D models, compare via AIC/BIC
- **Expected Insight:** Determine if conceptual domains align with statistical dimensions (may find When dimension poorly defined)
- **Feasibility:** Immediate (same data, different mirt() specifications in R)

**2. Item-Level Confidence Analysis:**
- **Current Limitation:** Item purification analysis focused on psychometric thresholds, not item content
- **Extension:** Examine which specific temporal items were excluded (What events? What temporal distances?), identify item features predicting difficulty
- **Expected Insight:** Inform future temporal confidence item development (avoid items with b > 3.0)
- **Feasibility:** 2-3 days (requires item metadata coding, not currently available)

**3. Confidence-Accuracy Calibration Study:**
- **Current Limitation:** Cannot directly link confidence ratings to trial-level accuracy (aggregate analysis only)
- **Extension:** Recruit N = 50 new participants, collect BOTH confidence ratings AND accuracy responses for SAME items (paired data)
- **Expected Insight:** Compute trial-level calibration curves, test whether When domain shows overconfidence/underconfidence specifically
- **Feasibility:** Requires new data collection (~6 months)

**4. Response Pattern Bias Correction:**
- **Current Limitation:** No bias correction applied for extreme response styles (solution.md section 1.4 transparency priority)
- **Extension:** If response pattern analysis (Immediate Follow-Up #3) reveals >30% extreme responders, apply IRT bias correction models
- **Expected Insight:** Determine if When domain's faster decline is ARTIFACT of response style or TRUE confidence pattern
- **Feasibility:** 1 week (requires IRT model extension with response style parameters)

### Theoretical Questions Raised

**1. Why Does Confidence Diverge from Accuracy?**
- **Question:** Ch5 5.2.1 found domain-invariant accuracy trajectories, but this RQ finds domain-SPECIFIC confidence trajectories. What cognitive mechanisms drive this dissociation?
- **Hypotheses:**
  - **Metacognitive monitoring failure:** Participants cannot accurately introspect on temporal memory quality
  - **Confidence heuristics:** Participants use simple rules ("temporal order is hard") rather than actual memory strength
  - **Measurement artifact:** TC_* confidence items may not validly measure metamemory (construct validity issue)
- **Next Steps:** Literature review on confidence-accuracy dissociations in episodic memory, design experiments manipulating monitoring cues
- **Feasibility:** Long-term theoretical research program (PhD dissertation topic)

**2. Are Temporal Confidence Items Fundamentally Problematic?**
- **Question:** 63% of When items excluded due to extreme difficulty (b > 3.0), versus 0% exclusion for What/Where. Is temporal confidence inherently harder to rate OR are items poorly designed?
- **Hypotheses:**
  - **Construct validity:** Temporal order is harder to judge confidence about (fewer retrieval cues)
  - **Item design:** TC_O_* items may use ambiguous wording, response scale anchors unclear
  - **Floor effects:** When domain accuracy is so poor (Ch5 findings) that participants cannot meaningfully rate confidence (responding randomly)
- **Next Steps:** Item content analysis (compare TC_O_* wording to TC_N_*/TC_D_* items), pilot test alternative temporal confidence formats
- **Feasibility:** Medium-term (6-12 months, requires item redesign and piloting)

**3. Is Decision D069 Dual-Scale Reporting Appropriate for Confidence Data?**
- **Question:** Probability scale transformation yields <25% "correct" probabilities, approaching 0% by Day 6. Does probability scale add interpretability OR obscure findings?
- **Hypotheses:**
  - **Confidence ` Accuracy:** Probability scale assumes confidence maps to performance probability, may not hold
  - **Extreme theta values:** IRT probability transformation breaks down for ¸ < -2.0 (floor effects)
  - **Context-dependent:** D069 appropriate for accuracy data (Ch5), questionable for confidence data (Ch6)
- **Next Steps:** Consult IRT methodologists on probability transformation validity for confidence ratings, consider alternative confidence interpretability metrics (percentiles? effect sizes?)
- **Feasibility:** Short-term (consultation, literature review)

### Priority Ranking

**High Priority (Do First):**
1. Clarify IRT probability transformation (addresses Anomaly 1, immediate code review)
2. Ch5 5.2.1 comparison (addresses deferred Step 8, completes analysis plan)
3. Document confidence response patterns (solution.md requirement, data quality check)

**Medium Priority (Subsequent):**
1. RQ 6.3.2 calibration analysis (natural next step in thesis, tests confidence validity)
2. Alternative IRT dimensionality (tests 3-factor assumption, uses current data)
3. Item-level confidence analysis (explains When domain purification issue)

**Lower Priority (Aspirational):**
1. Response pattern bias correction (only if High Priority #3 reveals extreme response issue)
2. Confidence-accuracy calibration study (ideal but requires new data collection)
3. Theoretical research program (long-term PhD work, outside current thesis scope)

### Next Steps Summary

The findings establish **domain-specific confidence decline with temporal confidence deteriorating fastest**, diverging from Ch5 accuracy findings. Three critical questions for immediate follow-up:

1. **Is probability transformation valid for GRM models?** (Addresses technical anomaly)
2. **How large is confidence-accuracy divergence?** (Completes planned Ch5 comparison)
3. **Do response patterns violate GRM assumptions?** (Data quality check)

Methodological extensions (calibration analysis, dimensionality testing) are valuable and feasible with current data. Theoretical questions (why confidence diverges from accuracy, whether temporal confidence is fundamentally problematic) require longer-term research programs beyond current thesis scope.
