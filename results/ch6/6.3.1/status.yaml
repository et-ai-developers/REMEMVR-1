  Analysis plan created: 8 steps planned (Step 0: extraction + Steps 1-7: analysis).
  Tool requirements: IRT calibration (GRM 3-factor for ordinal TC_* confidence data), 2-pass purification (D039), LMM Domain x Time interaction (D070 TSVR), post-hoc contrasts (D068 dual p-values), dual-scale trajectory plots (D069).
  Expected outputs: 11 data files, 8 log files. When domain conditional (exclude if <10 items post-purification). Validation required at every step.
rq_tools: success
context_dump: |
  11 analysis + 7 validation tools cataloged for IRT->LMM confidence trajectory analysis.
  GRM 3-factor ordinal model (5-category TC_* items), Decision D039/D068/D069/D070 embedded.
  When domain conditional (2-factor if <10 items post-purification, else 3-factor).
  All tools verified exist in tools_inventory.md, all naming conventions verified in names.md.
rq_analysis: success
context_dump: |
  8 steps specified with validation (IRT 2-pass GRM ordinal → LMM Domain x Time → dual-scale plots).
  All steps have complete specifications: catalogued tools (11 analysis + 7 validation) with full signatures OR stdlib operations with inline validation.
  Output path folder conventions validated: ALL CSV/TXT to data/, ALL logs to logs/, plots/ empty until rq_plots, results/ empty until rq_results.
  When domain conditional (2-factor if <10 items post-purification, else 3-factor). Decisions D039/D068/D069/D070 embedded.
