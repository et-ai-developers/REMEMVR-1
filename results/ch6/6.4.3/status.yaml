  rq_planner: |
    Analysis plan created: 5 steps planned (Step 0: data preparation + Steps 1-4: LMM analysis and comparison).
    Tool requirements: LMM fitting (3-way Age x Paradigm x Time interaction), dual p-value extraction (Decision D068), effect size computation (Cohen's f-squared), cross-chapter comparison (Ch5 accuracy vs Ch6 confidence).
    Expected outputs: 5 data files, 5 log files. Validation required at every step. Cross-RQ dependency on RQ 6.4.1 (theta scores) and RQ 5.3.4 (Ch5 comparison).
  rq_tools: |
    5 analysis + 5 validation tools cataloged for Age x Paradigm x Time LMM analysis
    All tools verified exist in tool_inventory.md (stdlib pandas.merge exempted from verification)
    Decision D068 (dual p-values) and D070 (TSVR time) embedded in tool specifications
    Cross-RQ dependencies documented: RQ 6.4.1 theta scores required, RQ 5.3.4 comparison optional
  rq_analysis: |
    5 steps specified with validation (LMM Age x Paradigm x Time interaction → effect sizes → Ch5/Ch6 comparison)
