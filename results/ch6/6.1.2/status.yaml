    6 analysis + 4 validation tools cataloged for confidence two-phase pattern testing
    Analysis: load_theta_confidence, create_piecewise_variables, fit_quadratic_lmm, compare_piecewise_continuous, extract_segment_slopes, compare_to_accuracy, prepare_twophase_plot_data
    Validation: validate_dataframe_structure, validate_lmm_convergence, validate_numeric_range, validate_plot_data_completeness
    Dependencies: RQ 6.1.1 (theta_confidence + tsvr_mapping), RQ 5.1.2 (accuracy comparison benchmark, optional)
    All tools verified exist in tools_inventory.md or stdlib (pandas/numpy)
  rq_analysis: |
    7 steps specified with validation (LMM two-phase pattern testing)
    Steps: 0=load_theta, 1=piecewise_vars, 2=quadratic_lmm, 3=compare_models, 4=slope_ratio, 5=ch5_comparison, 6=plot_data
    Analysis types: 3 stdlib (pandas ops), 3 catalogued (LMM tools), 1 stdlib (comparison)
    All output paths comply with folder conventions (data/ for CSV/TXT)

    CORRECTED 2025-12-11 00:35: Random slopes specification fixed in simple_steps_02_to_06_CORRECTED.py
    Original (simple_steps_02_to_06.py): Random intercept only due to tool bugs (methodologically incorrect)
    CORRECTED version: Random intercept + random slopes on TSVR_hours (Step 2), Time_Early+Time_Late (Step 3)
    Plan specification (2_plan.md line 191): theta ~ TSVR + TSVR^2 + (1 + TSVR | UID) - now implemented correctly
    All 3 models converged successfully with proper variance components
    PhD thesis requires methodological correctness - workaround was unacceptable
  rq_inspect: |
    Final validation (2025-12-11): ALL 4-LAYER VALIDATION PASSED
    Layer 1 (Existence): 8 files exist with >0 bytes, all paths correct
    Layer 2 (Structure): All column names + data types match plan.md expectations
    Layer 3 (Substance): Value ranges valid, no NaN, TSVR max=246h (2 participants >200h), SE=0.033 constant
    Layer 4 (Execution Log): No ERRORs, model converged, quadratic significant, all steps complete
  rq_plots: |
    Plot generated: twophase_trajectory.png (2x2 grid: theta + probability scales)
    Data sources: step06_twophase_theta_data.csv, step06_twophase_probability_data.csv
    D069 compliance: YES (dual-scale: theta top row, probability bottom row)
    Function used: plot_piecewise_trajectory (Early/Late segments, observed + fitted)
  rq_results: |
    Results synthesized from 6 sources: context_dumps + data files + plots + logs + concept + plan
    Key finding: INCONCLUSIVE two-phase pattern (1/3 tests support)
    Test 1 (Quadratic): SUPPORTS (p<0.001 Bonf) - significant curvature detected
    Test 2 (Piecewise): DOES NOT SUPPORT (AIC continuous=277.6, piecewise=315.6, delta=-37.9)
    Test 3 (Slope ratio): DOES NOT SUPPORT (ratio=0.909 >> 0.5 threshold)
    Unexpected: Confidence plateaus after Day 3 despite continued memory decline in accuracy
    Summary.md generated with 5 required sections: Findings, Plots, Interpretation, Limitations, Next Steps
    Anomalies documented: 0 plausibility concerns flagged (scientific findings coherent)
    D069 dual-scale interpretation included (theta + probability scales)

    VALIDATION STATUS: PASS (2025-12-11 00:40) - THESIS-READY
    6-layer validation complete: Data=PASS, Model=PASS, Scale=PASS, Stats=PASS, Cross=PASS, Thesis=PASS
    Total issues: 0 (CRITICAL=0, HIGH=0, MODERATE=0, LOW=0)
    Random slopes specification CORRECTED and validated (random intercept + random slopes on time variables)
    Model convergence: All 3 LMMs converged successfully with proper variance components
    Key strength: Methodologically correct PhD thesis specification (no workarounds accepted)
    Novel finding: Confidence-accuracy dissociation in temporal dynamics (thesis contribution)
