    RQ 5.2.8: Domain x Item Difficulty Interaction
    Type: Domains / Domain x Item Difficulty
    Analysis: Cross-classified LMM (pymer4) with UID x Item crossed effects
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.2.1 (item difficulty) + RAW responses (dfData.csv)
    Critical: 3-way Time x Difficulty_c x domain interaction, Bonferroni alpha=0.0033

    5.2.8 APPROVED 9.2/10. Theory strong (dual-process perirhinal-hippocampal), literature foundational. 3 moderate omissions (practice effects, ceiling effects, domain calibration clarity). Ready rq_stats. NOTE: rq_stats parallel run identified GLMM (binomial) required, not LMM.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    8.8/10 CONDITIONAL. GLMM (binomial) required not LMM (linear) - CRITICAL. Bonferroni inappropriate for exploratory analysis - CRITICAL. Random slopes with N=100 convergence risk - specify model selection strategy. 11 concerns across commission/omission/alternatives/pitfalls, all literature-cited. 3 required changes for approval.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 7 steps (Step 0: item difficulty loading + Steps 1-6: GLMM analysis)
    Tool requirements: Data loading, extraction, merging, centering, pymer4 GLMM (binomial), contrast extraction with D068 dual p-values, plot data prep
    Expected outputs: 18 data files, 7 log files. Validation mandatory per step.
    Cross-RQ dependency: RQ 5.2.1 (item parameters, purification list, TSVR mapping)
    Exploratory design: Omnibus 3-way interaction, post-hoc only if significant

rq_tools:
  status: fail
  context_dump: |
    FAIL - Missing Analysis Tools (TDD Detection Point)
    Required: pymer4 GLMM tools for cross-classified binomial models
    Missing from tools_inventory.md: fit_glmm_binomial, extract_glmm_fixed_effects
    Action: User + Claude migrate GLMM tools from v3.0 with TDD
    This is expected - Phase 22 validates TDD workflow
