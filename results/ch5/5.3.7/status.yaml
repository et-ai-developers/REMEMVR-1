    RQ 5.3.7: Paradigm-Specific Variance Decomposition
    Type: Paradigms / Variance Decomposition
    Analysis: LMM variance components + ICC (3 paradigms stratified)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.3.1 theta scores (1200 obs)
    Critical: 300 random effects output required for RQ 5.3.8

    RQ 5.3.7 validated: 9.1/10 CONDITIONAL. Strong theory (2.7/3) + interpretation (2.0/2) but sparse literature (1.5/2). 8 concerns: practice effects (CRITICAL), ceiling effects & dropout bias (MODERATE). Required: add 5 citations + practice effects discussion + limitations section. No re-validation needed after fixes.

    9.55/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 3.0/3 (convergence contingency resolves risk). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% tools). Cat3: 2.0/2 (scale clarified). Cat4: 2.3/2 (exceeds - residual diagnostics + Bates contingency plan). Cat5: 0.25/1 (3 minor, concept proactively addressed 80% of concerns). Improvements: Convergence Contingency Plan (Bates 2015), Residual Diagnostics (Schielzeth 2020), ICC Scale Interpretation, Practice Effects, Limitations.
