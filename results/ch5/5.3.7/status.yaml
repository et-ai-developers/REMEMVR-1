    RQ 5.3.7: Paradigm-Specific Variance Decomposition
    Type: Paradigms / Variance Decomposition
    Analysis: LMM variance components + ICC (3 paradigms stratified)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.3.1 theta scores (1200 obs)
    Critical: 300 random effects output required for RQ 5.3.8

    RQ 5.3.7 validated: 9.1/10 CONDITIONAL. Strong theory (2.7/3) + interpretation (2.0/2) but sparse literature (1.5/2). 8 concerns: practice effects (CRITICAL), ceiling effects & dropout bias (MODERATE). Required: add 5 citations + practice effects discussion + limitations section. No re-validation needed after fixes.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.55/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 3.0/3 (convergence contingency resolves risk). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% tools). Cat3: 2.0/2 (scale clarified). Cat4: 2.3/2 (exceeds - residual diagnostics + Bates contingency plan). Cat5: 0.25/1 (3 minor, concept proactively addressed 80% of concerns). Improvements: Convergence Contingency Plan (Bates 2015), Residual Diagnostics (Schielzeth 2020), ICC Scale Interpretation, Practice Effects, Limitations.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    7 steps planned (Step 0: data loading -> Step 6: ICC comparison + barplot data).
    Tool requirements: LMM variance decomposition (3 paradigm-stratified models), ICC computation (3 types), correlation tests (Decision D068 dual p-values).
    Expected outputs: 15 data files (variance components, ICC estimates, random effects, correlation tests, barplot data). Validation required at every step.

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    6 analysis + 7 validation tools cataloged for LMM variance decomposition.
    Custom tools verified: fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr, compute_icc_from_variance_components, extract_random_effects_from_lmm, test_intercept_slope_correlation_d068.
    Stdlib tools (pandas, pickle) exempt from verification.
    Decisions embedded: D068 (dual p-values), D070 (TSVR time variable).
    Critical: step04_random_effects.csv required for RQ 5.3.8 downstream dependency.

  timestamp: "2025-12-02T00:00:00Z"
  context_dump: |
    7 steps specified with validation (LMM variance decomposition - paradigm-stratified)
    Step 0: Load theta scores from RQ 5.3.1 (stdlib - pandas operations)
    Step 1: Load model metadata from RQ 5.3.1 (stdlib - pickle + model inspection)
    Step 2: Fit paradigm-stratified LMMs with random slopes (catalogued - fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr x3)
    Step 3: Compute ICC per paradigm (catalogued - compute_icc_from_variance_components)
    Step 4: Extract random effects (catalogued - extract_random_effects_from_lmm - CRITICAL for RQ 5.3.8)
    Step 5: Test intercept-slope correlation (catalogued - test_intercept_slope_correlation_d068)
    Step 6: Compare ICC across paradigms + prepare barplot data (stdlib - comparison + plot prep)
    All steps have paired validation (4 catalogued tools, 3 stdlib operations)
    All signatures complete with type hints
    Critical output: data/step04_random_effects.csv (300 rows) required for RQ 5.3.8 clustering
