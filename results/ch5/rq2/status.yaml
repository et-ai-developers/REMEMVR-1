    Results validated for scientific plausibility (summary.md already existed from prior run)
    Plausibility checks: Value ranges OK, model boundary warning noted, piecewise structure robust
    2 anomalies documented: When domain resilience (contradicts typical temporal fragility), consolidation benefit ranking reversal (When>Where>What, not Where>When>What as predicted)
    Dual-scale interpretation complete (theta + probability trajectories with practical significance)
