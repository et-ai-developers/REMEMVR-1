    RQ 5.12: CTT-IRT convergence via item purification
    Domains: What/Where/When (all three, full coverage)
    Analysis: Methodological comparison (Full CTT vs Purified CTT vs IRT)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.1 (IRT params, theta, TSVR) + raw dfData.csv for CTT
    Critical: Parallel LMM on 3 measurement approaches tests purification validity

    9.3/10 APPROVED. Strong psychometric theory. 1 CRITICAL omission (practice effects), needs recent citations. 6 suggested improvements. Ready for stats.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.5/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 2.9/3 (all critical fixes implemented). Cat2: 1.2/2 (40% tools, missing CTT module but well-specified). Cat3: 1.8/2 (strong parameters). Cat4: 1.7/2 (alpha added, minor gaps). Cat5: 0.9/1 (9 concerns, 0 CRITICAL). All 3 prior CRITICAL flaws corrected: Steiger's z, Cronbach's alpha, z-score standardization. Ready for planning.
