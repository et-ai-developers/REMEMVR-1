    RQ 5.12: CTT-IRT convergence via item purification
    Domains: What/Where/When (all three, full coverage)
    Analysis: Methodological comparison (Full CTT vs Purified CTT vs IRT)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.1 (IRT params, theta, TSVR) + raw dfData.csv for CTT
    Critical: Parallel LMM on 3 measurement approaches tests purification validity

rq_scholar:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.3/10 APPROVED. Strong psychometric theory. 1 CRITICAL omission (practice effects), needs recent citations. 6 suggested improvements. Ready for stats.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.5/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 2.9/3 (all critical fixes implemented). Cat2: 1.2/2 (40% tools, missing CTT module but well-specified). Cat3: 1.8/2 (strong parameters). Cat4: 1.7/2 (alpha added, minor gaps). Cat5: 0.9/1 (9 concerns, 0 CRITICAL). All 3 prior CRITICAL flaws corrected: Steiger's z, Cronbach's alpha, z-score standardization. Ready for planning.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9 analysis steps planned (Step 0: load data, Steps 1-8: CTT-IRT comparison)
    Pipeline: Hybrid CTT-IRT methodological comparison (Full CTT vs Purified CTT vs IRT theta)
    Analysis tools: Item mapping, CTT scoring, Cronbach's alpha (bootstrap CIs), Steiger's z-test (dependent correlations), z-score standardization, parallel LMMs (3 models), plot data prep
    Cross-RQ dependency: RQ 5.1 (IRT parameters, theta scores, TSVR mapping)
    Validation: Per-step validation mandatory (all 9 steps have 4-layer substance criteria)

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    3 analysis + 5 validation tools cataloged for CTT-IRT methodological comparison
    Analysis tools: compute_cronbachs_alpha, compare_correlations_dependent, fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr
    Validation tools: validate_numeric_range, validate_correlation_test_d068, validate_standardization, validate_lmm_convergence, validate_lmm_assumptions_comprehensive
    All tools verified exist in tools_inventory.md (CTT module created since initial FAIL)
    Most steps (0-3,6,8) use pandas stdlib operations (exempt from verification)
