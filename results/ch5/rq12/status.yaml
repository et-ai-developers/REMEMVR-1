    Analysis: Methodological comparison (Full CTT vs Purified CTT vs IRT)

    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.1 (IRT params, theta, TSVR) + raw dfData.csv for CTT

    Critical: Parallel LMM on 3 measurement approaches tests purification validity

    Tool requirements: CTT computation, Cronbach''s alpha (bootstrap), Steiger''s

    Expected outputs: Full/Purified CTT scores, reliability assessment, correlation
