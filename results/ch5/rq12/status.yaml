    RQ 5.12: CTT-IRT convergence via item purification
    Domains: What/Where/When (all three, full coverage)
    Analysis: Methodological comparison (Full CTT vs Purified CTT vs IRT)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.1 (IRT params, theta, TSVR) + raw dfData.csv for CTT
    Critical: Parallel LMM on 3 measurement approaches tests purification validity

    8.2/10 REJECTED. Cat1: 2.7/3 (Fisher's r-to-z error). Cat2: 1.4/2 (75% tools, missing Steiger's z). Cat3: 1.7/2 (parameters OK). Cat4: 1.5/2 (no Cronbach's alpha). Cat5: 0.9/1 (9 concerns). 3 CRITICAL fixes: Steiger's z-test, Cronbach's alpha, standardize outcomes for AIC.
