    RQ 5.7: Functional form comparison (linear, quad, log, combined)
    Domains: All (omnibus factor aggregating What/Where/When)
    Analysis: IRT (single factor) + LMM (5 candidate models), AIC selection
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.1 (step00_irt_input.csv, reprocessed with "All" factor)
    Critical: Exploratory (no directional hypothesis), Akaike weights quantify uncertainty

    RQ 5.7 validated: 9.3/10 APPROVED. Strong theory, 5 suggested improvements (practice effects CRITICAL, exponential decay MODERATE, recent cites MODERATE, model averaging MODERATE, omnibus limitations MODERATE). Ready for stats.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.3/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 2.6/3 (appropriate, AICc/exponential gaps). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 1.7/2 (well-specified, AICc gap). Cat4: 1.5/2 (good validation, convergence/practice gaps). Cat5: 0.5/1 (9 concerns, adequate)."

    5 analysis steps planned (Step 1: IRT calibration omnibus, Step 2: Data prep, Step 3: Fit 5 LMMs, Step 4: AIC selection, Step 5: Plot data)
    Tool requirements: IRT calibration (single "All" factor), LMM fitting (5 candidate models), AIC model comparison, probability transformation (D069 dual-scale)
    Expected outputs: 12 files (theta scores, 5 model objects, AIC comparison, best model summary, dual-scale plot CSVs). Validation required at every step.

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    4 analysis + 4 validation tools cataloged for functional form comparison
    Analysis: calibrate_irt (single-factor), fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr (5 models), compare_lmm_models_by_aic, convert_theta_to_probability
    Validation: IRT calibration, LMM convergence, Akaike weights (TDD), probability transform (TDD)
    WARNING: 2 validation tools (validate_akaike_weights, validate_probability_transform) NOT in tools_inventory.md - will trigger TDD during g_code execution
