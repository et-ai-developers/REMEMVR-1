    RQ 5.7: Functional form comparison (linear, quad, log, combined)
    Domains: All (omnibus factor aggregating What/Where/When)
    Analysis: IRT (single factor) + LMM (5 candidate models), AIC selection
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.1 (step00_irt_input.csv, reprocessed with "All" factor)
    Critical: Exploratory (no directional hypothesis), Akaike weights quantify uncertainty

    RQ 5.7 validated: 9.3/10 APPROVED. Strong theory, 5 suggested improvements (practice effects CRITICAL, exponential decay MODERATE, recent cites MODERATE, model averaging MODERATE, omnibus limitations MODERATE). Ready for stats.

  context_dump: "9.3/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 2.6/3 (appropriate, AICc/exponential gaps). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 1.7/2 (well-specified, AICc gap). Cat4: 1.5/2 (good validation, convergence/practice gaps). Cat5: 0.5/1 (9 concerns, adequate)."

    7 analysis steps planned with 2-pass IRT purification (Step 1: IRT Pass 1 all items, Step 2: Item purification Decision D039, Step 3: IRT Pass 2 purified items, Step 4: Data prep, Step 5: Fit 5 LMMs, Step 6: AIC selection, Step 7: Plot data)
    Tool requirements: IRT calibration (single "All" factor 2-pass), item purification (filter_items_by_quality), LMM fitting (5 candidate models), AIC model comparison, probability transformation (D069 dual-scale)
    Expected outputs: 15 files (Pass 1 theta/items, purified items list, Pass 2 theta/items, LMM input, 5 model objects, AIC comparison, best model summary, dual-scale plot CSVs). Validation required at every step.
    Next: rq_tools catalogues all analysis + validation tools
