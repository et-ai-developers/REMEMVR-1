    Analysis: Methodological comparison (Full CTT vs Purified CTT vs IRT)

    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.1 (IRT params, theta, TSVR) + raw dfData.csv for CTT

    Critical: Parallel LMM on 3 measurement approaches tests purification validity

    Tool requirements: CTT computation, Cronbach''s alpha (bootstrap), Steiger''s
    z-test (dependent correlations), parallel LMMs (3 models), z-score standardization.

    Expected outputs: Full/Purified CTT scores, reliability assessment, correlation
    analysis, LMM comparison (7 files), 2 plot source CSVs.

    Cross-RQ dependency: RQ 5.1 (purified items, theta scores, TSVR mapping). Validation

    Key outputs: 69 purified items (66% retention), CTT scores (full+purified), correlations (when domain: r 0.45->0.84), LMM comparison (3 models converged)

    Critical finding: When domain shows largest purification impact (19% item retention, +0.39 correlation improvement)
