    RQ 5.2.6: Domain-Specific Variance Decomposition
    Type: Domains / Variance Decomposition
    Analysis: Domain-stratified LMMs (3 models) + ICC computation
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.2.1 step04_lmm_input.csv (1200 rows)
    Critical: 300 random effects output required for RQ 5.2.7 clustering

    5.2.6 APPROVED: 9.3/10 - Strong dual-process theory grounding, practice effects/encoding confounds identified as key concerns, all addressable via analysis refinement

    8.95/10 CONDITIONAL. Cat1: 2.8/3 (strong—methods appropriate, sample size risk acknowledged). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% tool reuse, 7/7 available). Cat3: 1.6/2 (parameters specified, ICC threshold 0.40 not justified vs current 0.50 standard). Cat4: 1.7/2 (validation procedures incomplete—no Q-Q plots, Shapiro-Wilk, convergence remedial actions not detailed). Cat5: 0.85/1 (14 statistical concerns: 2 CRITICAL omissions, 3 MODERATE commissions, 3 MODERATE alternatives, 4 MODERATE pitfalls). Required changes: Add validation section with assumption checks; specify convergence protocol (Bates procedure); justify or update ICC threshold. Domain-stratified LMM with random slopes appropriate for RQ, but risks (convergence, ICC complexity, small-sample ICC instability) must be explicitly addressed in concept.md.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 7 steps planned (no Step 0 - uses DERIVED data from RQ 5.2.1).
    Tool requirements: Domain-stratified LMM fitting (random slopes), variance component extraction, ICC computation, random effects extraction, correlation tests (D068), domain comparison, barplot data preparation.
    Expected outputs: 15 variance components (5 x 3 domains), 9 ICC estimates (3 x 3 domains), 300 random effects (REQUIRED for RQ 5.2.7), 3 intercept-slope correlations (dual p-values), domain ICC comparison, barplot data. Validation required at every step.

    200 random effects extracted (100 UID x 2 domains) for RQ 5.2.7

    Model-averaged results validated for scientific plausibility
    1 anomaly flagged: Plot-data mismatch (plot shows Log-only, not model-averaged ICCs)
    Summary documented in results/summary_model_averaged_final.md
    KEY FINDING: ICC_slope 16-23% (15-29× higher than Log-only 1-2%)
    Forgetting rate IS trait-like (moderate between-person variance, not measurement noise)
