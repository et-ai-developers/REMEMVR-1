    RQ 5.4.8: Congruence × Item Difficulty Interaction
    Type: Congruence / Item Difficulty Interaction
    Analysis: Cross-classified LMM (item-level, pymer4)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.1 item parameters + RAW responses
    Critical: 3-way Time×Difficulty×Congruence, alpha=0.0033

    5.4.8 APPROVED 9.3/10. Exploratory item-difficulty × schema-congruence interaction strong theory + adequate literature. Flag: omit practice-effects discussion + VR encoding-specificity limitations. Suggested improvements provided. Ready for rq_planner.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    8.7/10 CONDITIONAL. Cross-classified LMM appropriate, 100% tool reuse. Critical gaps: (1) no LMM assumption diagnostics (residuals, homoscedasticity, outliers); (2) binary response normality violation unaddressed; (3) no 3-way interaction power analysis; (4) convergence contingencies incomplete. Required fixes: add assumption testing procedures, binary response justification, power analysis plan, expanded convergence protocol. See 1_stats.md for detailed recommendations.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    6 steps planned: GLMM-only pipeline (no IRT, uses RQ 5.4.1 item difficulty).
    Analysis: Cross-classified GLMM (binomial family, logit link) for binary responses.
    Dependencies: RQ 5.4.1 outputs (item_parameters.csv, tsvr_mapping.csv).
    Primary test: 3-way Time×Difficulty_c×Congruence interaction (Bonferroni alpha=0.0033).
    Outputs: GLMM summary, fixed/random effects, interaction extraction, 6-line plot source CSV.

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    6 analysis + 5 validation tools cataloged for GLMM-only pipeline.
    GLMM binomial family (binary responses), NO IRT (uses RQ 5.4.1 difficulty).
    Cross-classified random effects (UID x ItemID).
    D068 dual p-values (Bonferroni alpha=0.0033).
    Stdlib tools (pandas) exempt from tools_inventory.md verification.

rq_analysis:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    6 steps specified with validation (GLMM-only, no IRT calibration)
    Analysis: Cross-classified GLMM (binomial family, binary responses)
    3-way interaction: Time x Difficulty_c x Congruence (D068 dual p-values)
    Dependencies: RQ 5.4.1 outputs (item difficulty as predictor)
    Outputs: GLMM summary, fixed/random effects, interaction terms, 6-line plot CSV
