    RQ 5.4.8: Congruence × Item Difficulty Interaction
    Type: Congruence / Item Difficulty Interaction
    Analysis: Cross-classified LMM (item-level, pymer4)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.1 item parameters + RAW responses
    Critical: 3-way Time×Difficulty×Congruence, alpha=0.0033

    5.4.8 APPROVED 9.3/10. Exploratory item-difficulty × schema-congruence interaction strong theory + adequate literature. Flag: omit practice-effects discussion + VR encoding-specificity limitations. Suggested improvements provided. Ready for rq_planner.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    8.7/10 CONDITIONAL. Cross-classified LMM appropriate, 100% tool reuse. Critical gaps: (1) no LMM assumption diagnostics (residuals, homoscedasticity, outliers); (2) binary response normality violation unaddressed; (3) no 3-way interaction power analysis; (4) convergence contingencies incomplete. Required fixes: add assumption testing procedures, binary response justification, power analysis plan, expanded convergence protocol. See 1_stats.md for detailed recommendations.
