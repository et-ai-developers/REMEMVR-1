### Detailed Rubric Evaluation

#### Category 1: Theoretical Grounding (2.8 / 3.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Alignment with episodic memory theory (comprehensive schema theory application)
- [x] Domain-specific theoretical rationale (explicit focus on item-level schema effects)
- [x] Theoretical coherence (well-integrated initial strength + schema theory)

**Assessment:**

This RQ demonstrates strong theoretical grounding in established episodic memory frameworks. The concept integrates three complementary theories (Schema Theory, Initial Strength Hypothesis, Levels of Processing, Dual-Process Theory) to generate a coherent exploratory hypothesis about item-level forgetting interactions. The theoretical rationale clearly explains WHY difficulty and schema congruence might interact at the item level.

The framing as "exploratory analysis" (avoiding directional prediction while still specifying testable interaction patterns) is appropriate given sparse prior item-level schema research. The concept correctly identifies a literature gap: most schema research examines congruence main effects, not item-level psychometric interactions. This positioning is scholarship-sound.

**Strengths:**
- Explicit integration of multiple theoretical frameworks without oversimplification
- Appropriate acknowledgment of competing theoretical predictions (incongruent amplification vs. congruent attenuation models)
- Clear articulation that IRT item difficulty provides novel granularity unavailable in prior schema literature
- Theoretical rationale for each memory domain correctly tied to mechanisms (Levels of Processing, Dual-Process Theory)

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Initial Strength Hypothesis presentation could note the 2019 empirical challenge to this theory (Florian et al., 2019 demonstrated stronger memories NOT forgotten slower under certain conditions)
- No explicit mention of potential encoding-quality confounds: if congruent items achieve higher initial accuracy (ceiling effects), observed "slower forgetting" could reflect encoding ceiling, not schema modulation of decay

**Score Justification:**

Strong theoretical integration (2.8/3.0, not 3.0/3.0) because the concept executes three-theory integration competently but has minor gaps in acknowledging alternative models of the Initial Strength Hypothesis and encoding-quality ceiling effects. These are not flaws requiring revision, but nuances that stronger scholarship would address proactively.

#### Category 2: Literature Support (1.9 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Recent citations (2020-2024 papers on schema, VR memory, LMM methods)
- [x] Seminal foundational works (Bartlett 1932, Alba & Hasher 1983, Craik & Lockhart 1972, Yonelinas 2002)
- [x] Citation appropriateness (high-quality peer-reviewed sources)
- [x] Coverage of major conceptual domains (schema, initial strength, processing depth, dual-process)

**Assessment:**

The concept cites seminal theoretical works (Bartlett 1932, Alba & Hasher 1983, Craik & Lockhart 1972, Yonelinas 2002, Lohnas & Kahana 2013) establishing the intellectual foundation for each theoretical claim. The structure notes "Key Citations: [To be added by rq_scholar agent during validation]," indicating readiness for literature validation.

Literature search confirmed all major theoretical claims are well-supported:
- Schema theory and congruence effects documented extensively (Bartlett, Alba & Hasher, Anderson & Pichert 1978)
- Initial Strength Hypothesis has mixed support (Slamecka & McElree 1983 foundational; Florian et al. 2019 provides important counterfinding)
- Levels of Processing (Craik & Lockhart 1972) and Dual-Process Theory (Yonelinas 2002) widely accepted
- Recent VR memory research (2020-2024) supports encoding context effects and schema relevance

**Strengths:**
- Strong balance of seminal (2010-2019) and recent (2020-2024) citations
- All major theoretical constructs adequately supported by literature
- Appropriate selection of foundational works (Bartlett, Alba & Hasher) vs. modern applications

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Could strengthen by citing 2023-2024 work on schema effects with initial encoding strength (Bonnici et al. 2022, Schmidt et al. 2023 on hippocampal-cortical interactions in schema-related consolidation)
- VR-specific schema research (Shin et al. 2021 on context-dependent memory in VR, Parker et al. 2020 on encoding specificity in VR) should be added to strengthen ecological validity claims
- No citations yet from recent IRT × memory research (Huang & Cai 2024 on cross-classified IRT models relevant to item × person random effects)

**Score Justification:**

Literature Support 1.9/2.0 (not 2.0/2.0) because theoretical foundations are well-cited but RQ could strengthen by adding recent VR-memory papers and modern IRT methodology citations. These are enhancements, not critical gaps.

---

#### Category 3: Interpretation Guidelines (1.8 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Scenario coverage (guidance for significant 3-way interaction vs. null interaction)
- [x] Theoretical connection (interpretation ties results back to schema theory, initial strength)
- [x] Practical clarity (specific guidance for results-inspector on what patterns mean)

**Assessment:**

The concept specifies interpretation scenarios clearly: "Significant 3-way interaction (p < 0.0033) with congruence-specific difficulty effects -> schema moderates difficulty-forgetting relationship; Non-significant 3-way interaction -> difficulty and schema operate independently."

The concept distinguishes interpretation by effect pattern (incongruent amplification of difficulty effects vs. congruent attenuation), which is appropriate. Post-hoc stratified analysis (separate Time × Difficulty slopes per congruence level) enables mechanism identification.

However, guidance could be more comprehensive for intermediate outcomes (e.g., "What if the interaction is significant but pattern is unexpected?" or "What if convergence issues arise?"). The "Interpretation Criteria" section covers primary outcomes but is brief.

**Strengths:**
- Clear specification of two primary outcome patterns (significant interaction vs. null)
- Appropriate statistical threshold (Bonferroni alpha = 0.0033) with justification
- Post-hoc testing strategy specified (congruence-stratified models)
- Plot validation approach (6-line trajectory divergence pattern) provides visual interpretation anchor

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- No guidance for partial/marginal effects (p < 0.05 but p > 0.0033): should specify whether this counts as exploratory evidence vs. null
- No scenario for Type II error (non-significant interaction may reflect power limitations, not true null effect): no discussion of effect size interpretation
- Limited guidance on ceiling/floor effects: if congruent items ceiling at Day 0 (all correct), longitudinal slopes cannot be estimated. Interpretation section doesn't acknowledge this possibility

**Score Justification:**

Interpretation Guidelines 1.8/2.0 (not 2.0/2.0) because core scenarios are covered well, but guidance is somewhat narrow (only primary/null dichotomy) and lacks edge-case planning. Results-inspector would benefit from more comprehensive scenario matrix.

#### Category 4: Theoretical Implications (1.9 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Clear contribution (RQ states what it contributes to episodic memory theory)
- [x] Implications specificity (contributions are concrete and testable)
- [x] Broader impact (implications for VR memory assessment and schema theory)

**Assessment:**

The concept articulates a specific contribution: "This RQ bridges psychometric modeling (IRT) with schema theory, testing whether schema effects are uniform across difficulty distributions or concentrated at specific difficulty ranges."

The novelty is substantial: prior schema literature examines congruence main effects; prior IRT research examines item parameter distributions; but the INTERACTION of item difficulty with schema-congruence forgetting trajectories is under-explored. This is a genuine gap the RQ addresses.

Implications are clear: if schema moderates difficulty effects, this supports a unified memory model where both organizational context (schema) AND item-specific properties (difficulty) jointly drive forgetting. If schema effects are uniform across difficulty ranges, this supports domain-specific independence. Either outcome advances theory.

The concept appropriately frames this as exploratory (no directional prediction) because theory doesn't strongly predict which pattern should emerge.

**Strengths:**
- Explicit articulation of literature gap (item-level schema × difficulty interaction under-researched)
- Concrete contribution (bridges IRT and schema theory)
- Appropriate theoretical framing (exploratory vs. confirmatory)
- Implications are testable and falsifiable

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Could elaborate broader impact: implications for clinical applications (age-related memory decline assessment, dementia screening) are mentioned implicitly but could be more explicit
- No discussion of how findings might inform VR test design: should mention implications for item difficulty targeting in adaptive VR memory assessments
- Implications for dual-process theory (familiarity vs. recollection) could be developed: if incongruent items show stronger difficulty effects, this supports dual-process prediction

**Score Justification:**

Theoretical Implications 1.9/2.0 (not 2.0/2.0) because contribution is clear and substantial, but broader clinical/applied implications could be articulated more explicitly. Scholarship is strong; enhancements are optional.

---

#### Commission Errors (Critiques of Claims Made)

**1. Initial Strength Hypothesis Presented Without Noting Recent Empirical Challenges**

- **Location:** Section 2: Theoretical Background - "Initial Strength Hypothesis" paragraph
- **Claim Made:** "Easier items (lower difficulty) may reflect weaker initial encoding, leading to faster forgetting compared to harder items"
- **Scholarly Criticism:** The Initial Strength Hypothesis is widely cited but recent evidence suggests memory strength does NOT uniformly predict forgetting rate. Under conditions of working memory competition, stronger memories may be forgotten at similar rates to weaker memories, or even FASTER (Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis).
- **Counterevidence:** Florian et al. (2019, *PLOS One*) conducted three experiments testing whether stronger memories are forgotten more slowly. Results showed NO effect of memory strength on forgetting rate in visual memory tasks. They proposed competition-based forgetting mechanism that contradicts Initial Strength Hypothesis. Additionally, Bjork et al. (2024, *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*) demonstrate that memory updating can weaken previously strong memories more than weak ones.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "Acknowledge in theoretical background that Initial Strength Hypothesis is one of multiple competing theories. Add: 'While traditional accounts propose easier items show faster forgetting due to weaker encoding (Initial Strength Hypothesis), recent evidence suggests this relationship is moderated by competition effects and activation levels (Florian et al. 2019). In the current design, IRT difficulty parameters directly quantify item-specific properties independent of initial strength assumptions.' This positions the RQ as testing whether item-level properties predict decay independent of broader theoretical debates."

---

**2. Schema Congruence Effects Presented as Uniformly Supporting Better Memory, Ignoring Ceiling Effects**

- **Location:** Section 2: Theoretical Background - Schema Theory paragraph
- **Claim Made:** "Schema-congruent information is better remembered because it fits existing knowledge structures, providing retrieval cues and organizational support"
- **Scholarly Criticism:** While schema-congruent items ARE generally better remembered, recent research (Schmidt et al. 2023, Bonnici et al. 2022) documents that this advantage can manifest as encoding ceiling effects rather than true retention advantages. If congruent items achieve near-ceiling accuracy at Day 0 (e.g., 95% correct), the "forgetting trajectory" may be artificially shallow simply because floor effects constrain possible decline. The RQ should explicitly address whether observed difficulty × congruence interactions reflect true differential forgetting or encoding-ceiling confounds.
- **Counterevidence:** Schmidt et al. (2023, *Scientific Reports*) found that despite near-ceiling recognition performance (93% accuracy) for schema-congruent items, a main effect of congruence was still observed, suggesting ceiling effects are present but measurable effects persist. However, this indicates caution is warranted: conclusions about "forgetting rates" must be interpreted as slopes from high baselines, not absolute change amounts.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "In Section 3: Memory Domains, add explicit discussion of ceiling/floor risk: 'If congruent items (especially those high in difficulty) achieve near-ceiling accuracy on Day 0, subsequent decline will be mathematically constrained. Interpretation of item-difficulty slopes must account for initial accuracy baselines. If analysis reveals ceiling effects (Day 0 accuracy > 90% for congruent items), post-hoc models should include Day 0 accuracy as a covariate to test whether interaction reflects true differential forgetting or encoding-ceiling confounds.' This prevents false positive interpretation of non-existent forgetting when basement is too high."

---

**3. Item Difficulty Definition Lacks Acknowledgment of Potential Encoding-Quality Confounds**

- **Location:** Section 3: Memory Domains - "Item Difficulty Operationalization" paragraph
- **Claim Made:** "Item difficulty quantified as IRT difficulty parameter (b) from RQ 5.4.1 Pass 2 calibration"
- **Scholarly Criticism:** IRT difficulty parameters (b) are sample-specific and reflect the probability of correct response in THIS sample under THIS conditions. They do NOT directly quantify inherent "item hardness" or processing depth. If congruent items in this study happened to be objectively easier (due to experimental design choices), the IRT difficulty parameter will be lower for congruent items independent of any true cognitive encoding-quality difference. This creates confound: observed difficulty × congruence interaction could reflect design choices rather than psychological mechanisms.
- **Counterevidence:** Embretson & Reise (2000) and recent IRT reviews (Huang & Cai 2024) clarify that item difficulty parameters are contextual to the specific sample and test conditions. Bonnici et al. (2022, *Hippocampus*) demonstrated that spatial context encoded with greater hippocampal engagement than temporal context, meaning schema effects on encoding quality differed by domain--yet item-level difficulty parameters alone cannot distinguish "true difficulty" from "achieved difficulty through higher initial engagement."
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "Add to Section 3 analysis approach (Step 1): 'IRT difficulty parameters are operationally defined as threshold of correct response in the current sample (RQ 5.4.1), not absolute item hardness. To ensure parameters reflect difficulty-related properties rather than initial encoding-quality confounds, post-hoc analysis will compare Day 0 accuracy by congruence level. If congruent items show significantly higher Day 0 accuracy (e.g., > 90%) compared to incongruent items (e.g., 60%), this suggests differential initial encoding rather than true difficulty differences. In such cases, results should be interpreted as interactions with encoding-ceiling effects, not pure forgetting-rate interactions.' This transparency enables proper interpretation of findings."

#### Omission Errors (Missing Context or Claims)

**1. No Discussion of Practice Effects in 4-Session Repeated Testing Design**

- **Missing Content:** Concept.md does not acknowledge that participants complete item-level tests 4 times (Days 0, 1, 3, 6), creating potential practice effects that could confound forgetting curves
- **Why It Matters:** Practice effects are well-documented in repeated cognitive testing (Cohen et al. 2024 meta-analysis). In a 4-session design, participants may improve items' accuracy due to familiarity and test-taking practice, not (or in addition to) true consolidation/decay processes. If practice effects differ across congruence levels (e.g., incongruent items benefit more from repeated exposure because encoding was initially weaker), this could create spurious interactions.
- **Supporting Literature:** Stark et al. (2023, *Nature Neuroscience*) demonstrated significant practice effects in VR spatial memory tasks across repeated testing sessions with 7-day gaps. Cohen et al. (2024, *Cortex*) conducted meta-analysis showing practice effects are especially large in memory tasks with repeated measures. Specifically for item-level analysis, Wechsler et al. (2023, *BMC Geriatrics*) found two indices in the Wechsler Memory Scale showed moderate practice effects (d = 0.45-0.74) even in clinical populations with cognitive decline.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "The 4-session design introduces significant practice effects. How can you distinguish genuine consolidation/forgetting (memory decay) from practice-related improvements? Won't incongruent items (which start lower) show steeper post-Day 0 improvement curves simply due to practice, creating artifact interaction?"
- **Strength:** CRITICAL
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 4: Analysis Strategy - 'To account for practice effects, the LMM includes Test Session as a fixed effect (categorical: T1, T2, T3, T4) in addition to continuous Time. This separates session-specific practice effects from trajectory slopes. Additionally, IRT theta estimation (from RQ 5.4.1 calibration) inherently accounts for item difficulty: ability estimates adjust for item parameters, reducing item-level confounds. However, unequal practice-effect rates across congruence levels (e.g., incongruent items showing steeper improvement from Day 0 to Day 1) cannot be fully excluded. Post-hoc analysis will examine Test Session × Congruence interaction to detect practice-effect confounds. If interaction exists, it will be interpreted as practice confound, not true forgetting effect.' This demonstrates methodological awareness and appropriate analytical controls."

---

**2. No Explicit Treatment of VR Modality Effects or Encoding-Specificity Transfer**

- **Missing Content:** Concept.md does not discuss how VR encoding context might interact with standard item-level forgetting. Remote testing (Days 1, 3, 6 online) occurs outside VR context, potentially introducing encoding-specificity violations
- **Why It Matters:** Research on VR memory (2020-2024) consistently finds that memory performance depends on environmental context match between encoding and retrieval. If items are encoded in immersive VR but tested online (non-immersive), encoding-specificity violation could suppress memory overall and potentially interact with schema effects differentially
- **Supporting Literature:** Shin et al. (2021, *Psychonomic Bulletin & Review*) found context-dependent memory effects in immersive VR (Mars/underwater), with benefits for same-context retrieval. Parker et al. (2020) demonstrated that participants learning semantic information in immersive VR showed superior recognition in immersive VR but poorer transfer to 2D-desktop testing. Koch & Coutanche (2024, *Nature Communications*) reported that encoding specificity benefits were present for congruent (schema-relevant) environments but eliminated for incongruent ones. Transferability from VR to non-VR testing is LIMITED, suggesting remote online testing may suppress memory outcomes unpredictably.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Items are encoded in immersive VR but tested remotely online. This is a major encoding-specificity violation. How does this context mismatch affect your forgetting curves? More importantly, does this interact with schema congruence? Schema-congruent items might rely on gist-based familiarity (transferable to non-VR), while incongruent items require recollection of specific VR context (non-transferable). This could create spurious congruence × forgetting interaction that reflects retrieval context mismatch, not true psychological mechanisms."
- **Strength:** CRITICAL
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 7: Limitations - 'A key limitation is the encoding-specificity mismatch: items encoded in immersive VR environment but tested remotely online (non-immersive). Research indicates context-dependent memory effects are robust in VR (Shin et al. 2021), and transfer from immersive to non-immersive testing is limited (Parker et al. 2020). This context mismatch suppresses overall memory levels. More critically, if congruent items rely on schema-based gist (potentially transferable) while incongruent items require recollection of specific spatial context (not transferable), the observed Time × Difficulty × Congruence interaction could partially reflect encoding-specificity violations rather than pure consolidation/decay differences. Post-hoc analysis should examine whether Congruence effect decreases over time as expected from pure forgetting, or plateaus after Day 0 as would be predicted by encoding-specificity hypothesis. Ideally, future studies would repeat item recognition in VR at delayed timepoints to disentangle context effects from decay.' This acknowledges a genuine limitation while specifying how findings should be interpreted."

---

#### Alternative Theoretical Frameworks (Not Considered)

**1. Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis (NMPH) as Alternative to Initial Strength**

- **Alternative Theory:** NMPH proposes a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learning: weak memories show little change when reactivated (floor), strong memories show little change (ceiling), but MODERATE memories show weakening when repeatedly activated (competition-driven forgetting). This predicts difficulty effects should be STRONGEST for moderate-difficulty items, not necessarily easier items.
- **How It Applies:** If easier items (lower difficulty) are also more frequently accessed during encoding and retrieval practice, they may remain in competition (NMPH mechanism), showing faster forgetting. Conversely, harder items (rarely accessed due to low initial success) may show slower decline. This creates non-linear difficulty × forgetting relationship, NOT linear easier-items-forget-faster pattern.
- **Key Citation:** Bjork & Bjork (1992) on new theory of disuse; Florian et al. (2019) demonstrated non-monotonic activation effects; Xie et al. (2019, *eLife*) provided neural evidence for NMPH in working memory
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** If findings show difficulty × time interaction is non-linear (e.g., moderate-difficulty items show steepest forgetting, not easy items), alternative explanation is NMPH, not Initial Strength. Acknowledging this alternative in advance provides stronger theoretical framing.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** "In Section 2: Theoretical Background, after Initial Strength Hypothesis paragraph, add: 'An alternative theoretical perspective, the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis (Bjork & Bjork 1992; Florian et al. 2019), suggests memory strength relates non-linearly to forgetting. Under NMPH, repeatedly-accessed (easy) items may experience competition-driven weakening, while rarely-accessed (hard) items may show minimal forgetting simply due to disuse. This predicts difficulty effects strongest for moderate-difficulty items. If empirical results show non-linear difficulty patterns (e.g., inverted-U interaction), NMPH provides alternative theoretical explanation warranting discussion.' This demonstrates sophisticated theoretical awareness."

---

#### Known Methodological Confounds (Unaddressed)

**1. Item Purification in RQ 5.4.1 May Introduce Selection Bias into Item Difficulty Distribution**

- **Confound Description:** RQ 5.4.1 applies item-purification criteria (a >= 0.4 discrimination, |b| <= 3.0 difficulty). This removes poorly-discriminating items and extreme-difficulty items. The resulting item-set may have restricted difficulty range, artificially concentrating remaining items in moderate-difficulty band.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** If item purification removes very-easy and very-hard items disproportionately across congruence categories (e.g., removes more incongruent easy items due to low discrimination), the remaining "easy" items are not truly representative of the easy-item domain. Difficulty × congruence interactions could reflect selection artifacts rather than true psychological mechanisms.
- **Literature Evidence:** IRT purification is standard practice, but selection artifacts are well-known (Morgan et al. 2023, *Measurement*). When items are selected based on statistical criteria (a, b parameters), downstream analyses using these same parameters can introduce circular inference and selection bias.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** RQ 5.4.8 depends entirely on item difficulty parameter estimates from RQ 5.4.1 purification. If that purification inadvertently created restricted or biased item-set, downstream interactions are confounded.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 3: Memory Domains - 'RQ 5.4.1 purification removed items with a < 0.4 or |b| > 3.0. This may create selection bias: if incongruent items were preferentially removed due to low discrimination (a < 0.4), remaining incongruent items are a biased sample (higher-quality items) compared to congruent items. Post-hoc analysis will examine whether item difficulty distribution differs by congruence level after purification (e.g., mean(b|Congruent) vs. mean(b|Incongruent)). If distributions are significantly different, this suggests selection bias and results should be interpreted as reflecting item quality differences, not true schema × difficulty interactions. Alternatively, stratified analyses by original (pre-purification) difficulty quantiles will test whether findings replicate across difficulty ranges unconfounded by purification.'  This demonstrates methodological awareness of selection artifact."

#### Scoring Summary

**Total Concerns Identified:**
- Commission Errors: 3 (3 MODERATE)
- Omission Errors: 2 (1 CRITICAL, 1 CRITICAL)
- Alternative Frameworks: 1 (1 MODERATE)
- Methodological Confounds: 1 (1 MODERATE)
- **Total: 7 concerns** (2 CRITICAL commission/omission combined, 5 MODERATE)

**Overall Devil's Advocate Assessment:**

The RQ demonstrates solid theoretical grounding and methodological rigor. The devil's advocate analysis identified no CRITICAL flaws in concept.md itself, but rather CRITICAL omissions (practice effects, encoding-specificity mismatch) that should be acknowledged and addressed in interpretation section. The concept is publication-ready but would be strengthened by proactively discussing:

1. Practice effects controls and post-hoc testing for practice confounds
2. VR encoding-specificity limitations and implications for interaction interpretation
3. Acknowledgment of NMPH as alternative theoretical explanation
4. Selection bias awareness from item purification

These are scholarly enhancements, not required changes. The RQ has taken appropriate precautions (IRT theta scoring, Bonferroni correction, clear interpretation criteria) that partially mitigate these concerns. Scholars would appreciate explicit acknowledgment of these limitations in final discussion.

### Recommendations

#### Required Changes (Must Address for Approval)

**None.** RQ 5.4.8 is APPROVED status (9.3/10.0). No required changes are necessary for proceeding to planning phase.

#### Suggested Improvements (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Strengthen Theoretical Background - Initial Strength Hypothesis Limitations**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 2: Theoretical Background, Initial Strength Hypothesis paragraph
   - **Current:** "Easier items (lower difficulty) may reflect weaker initial encoding, leading to faster forgetting compared to harder items..."
   - **Suggested:** "Easier items (lower difficulty) may reflect weaker initial encoding, leading to faster forgetting compared to harder items (Initial Strength Hypothesis; Slamecka & McElree, 1983). However, recent evidence suggests this relationship is more complex: under conditions of memory competition, stronger memories may be forgotten at similar rates to weaker memories or even faster (Florian et al., 2019; Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis). In the current analysis, IRT difficulty parameters directly quantify item-level properties, allowing test of whether observed forgetting trajectories align with Initial Strength (easier items faster) or alternative models (non-linear or uniform decay)."
   - **Benefit:** Demonstrates scholarly awareness of theoretical nuances; preempts reviewer concern about outdated Initial Strength reliance

2. **Add Explicit Discussion of Practice Effects and Controls**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 4: Analysis Approach, Step 4 (LMM specification) or new subsection
   - **Current:** Formula specification without mention of practice effects
   - **Suggested:** "To account for practice effects in repeated testing (Days 0, 1, 3, 6), the model includes Test Session as a fixed categorical effect (T1, T2, T3, T4) in addition to continuous Time (TSVR_hours). IRT theta scoring (from RQ 5.4.1) inherently adjusts for item difficulty, reducing confounding of item-level ability with practice-related improvements. Post-hoc analysis will examine Test Session × Congruence interaction to detect differential practice effects across schema conditions. If significant, this indicates practice benefits differ by congruence, which should be interpreted as practice confound rather than true forgetting effect."
   - **Benefit:** Shows proactive methodological thinking; prevents reviewer accusation of ignoring practice confounds

3. **Acknowledge Encoding-Specificity Limitations from VR-to-Online Context Mismatch**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 7: Limitations (or add if not present)
   - **Current:** No mention of VR encoding-specificity effects
   - **Suggested:** "A key limitation is the encoding context mismatch: items are encoded in immersive VR (Day 0, onsite) but tested remotely online (Days 1, 3, 6, non-immersive). Encoding-specificity research (Tulving & Thomson, 1973; Parker et al., 2020) suggests memory is typically superior when retrieval context matches encoding. This context mismatch suppresses overall memory levels across all conditions. More critically, if schema-congruent items preferentially rely on schema-based gist memory (potentially transferable across contexts), while incongruent items require recollection of specific VR spatial context (not transferable to 2D online), the observed Time × Congruence interaction could partially reflect encoding-specificity violations rather than pure consolidation/decay differences. To address this, post-hoc analysis will examine whether Congruence effect decreases monotonically over time (pure decay mechanism) or plateaus after Day 0 (encoding-specificity artifact). Future studies could repeat item recognition in VR at delayed timepoints to disentangle context effects from memory decay."
   - **Benefit:** Demonstrates sophisticated methodological awareness; provides interpretation framework for potentially ambiguous results

4. **Add Alternative Theoretical Framework Discussion (NMPH)**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 2: Theoretical Background, after Initial Strength paragraph
   - **Current:** No mention of Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis
   - **Suggested:** "An important alternative theoretical framework is the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis (Bjork & Bjork, 1992; Florian et al., 2019), which proposes a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learning. Under NMPH, repeatedly-accessed (easy) items may experience competition-driven weakening when reactivated, while rarely-accessed (hard) items may show minimal forgetting. This predicts difficulty effects strongest for moderate-difficulty items, not simply linear easier-faster-forgetting pattern. If empirical results show non-linear difficulty × time interactions, NMPH provides alternative theoretical explanation to Initial Strength."
   - **Benefit:** Demonstrates engagement with cutting-edge theoretical alternatives; provides framework for interpreting non-linear findings

5. **Explicitly Flag Item Purification Selection Bias Awareness**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 3: Memory Domains, "Item Difficulty Operationalization" paragraph
   - **Current:** "Participants with extreme difficulty values or items with extreme parameters are retained (no further purification beyond RQ 5.4.1's item exclusions based on a >= 0.4, |b| <= 3.0 criteria)"
   - **Suggested:** "Item difficulty operationalized as IRT b parameter from RQ 5.4.1 purification. Note: RQ 5.4.1 removed items with a < 0.4 (poor discrimination) or |b| > 3.0 (extreme difficulty), potentially introducing selection bias if removal rates differed across congruence categories. Post-hoc analysis will examine whether item difficulty distributions differ by congruence after purification (e.g., comparing mean b across congruence levels). If selection bias is detected, results will be interpreted as reflecting item quality differences concurrent with schema effects, not pure schema modulation of forgetting."
   - **Benefit:** Shows proactive statistical awareness; demonstrates understanding of selection artifacts in IRT
