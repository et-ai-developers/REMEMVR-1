# RQ 5.5.3: Source-Destination Age Effects

**Chapter:** 5
**Type:** Source-Destination
**Subtype:** Age Effects
**Full ID:** 5.5.3

---

## Research Question

**Primary Question:**
Does age moderate the source (-U-) vs destination (-D-) memory difference, or the forgetting rate for either location type?

**Scope:**
Tests 3-way Age x Location Type x Time interaction. Uses methodology from RQ 5.2.3, 5.3.4, 5.4.3 (age RQs for other factor structures).

---

## Theoretical Background

**Relevant Theories:**
- Older adults show reduced executive function, which may differentially affect destination selection (requiring decision-making) vs source encoding (more automatic)
- Age-related hippocampal decline affects spatial memory generally, but may show location-type specificity
- If source vs destination difference exists, age may modulate its magnitude

**Predictions:**
Given the universal null pattern for age effects in Chapter 5, we expect:
- **Primary prediction:** NULL (Age x Location Type x Time interaction not significant)
- **Consistent with:** 5.1.3, 5.2.3, 5.3.4, 5.4.3 (all null for age effects)

---

## Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis:**
Age will NOT significantly moderate the source-destination difference or forgetting rates (3-way interaction p > 0.05).

**Rationale:**
The universal null pattern for age effects suggests age-invariant forgetting in ecological VR encoding. This should replicate for source-destination.

## Analysis Approach

**Design:**
- LMM with Age (continuous) x Location Type x Time
- Use best-fit model from RQ 5.5.1
- Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons

**Dependencies:**
- RQ 5.5.1 MUST be complete

## Notes

**Matches:** RQ 5.2.3 (Domain Age), 5.3.4 (Paradigm Age), 5.4.3 (Congruence Age)
**Expected:** NULL (consistent with Chapter 5 pattern)
