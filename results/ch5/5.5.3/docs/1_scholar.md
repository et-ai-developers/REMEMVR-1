### Detailed Rubric Evaluation

#### 1. Theoretical Grounding (2.5 / 3.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Alignment with episodic memory theory (source-destination distinction grounded in encoding processes)
- [x] Domain-specific theoretical rationale (executive function vs automatic encoding differences)
- [ ] Fully developed theoretical coherence (streamlined due to replication nature, but lacks depth)

**Assessment:**

The concept.md provides theoretically valid rationale for why age might moderate source-destination differences. The executive function hypothesis (destination selection requires decision-making, source encoding more automatic) aligns with established frontal lobe theories of aging. The hippocampal decline prediction is appropriate for spatial memory generally.

However, the document is deliberately streamlined as a **null-hypothesis replication RQ**. While this is methodologically sound (testing whether the universal null pattern for age effects extends to source-destination comparisons), it results in minimal theoretical development compared to hypothesis-driven RQs.

**Strengths:**
- Clear connection to executive function aging literature (frontal lobe hypothesis)
- Appropriate recognition that source vs destination may differ in cognitive demands (automatic vs controlled processing)
- Transparent about expected null result based on Chapter 5 pattern

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- No citations provided for executive function claims or hippocampal decline theories
- Doesn't discuss WHY age effects might be universally null in this study (ecological VR, practice effects, cohort characteristics)
- Missing discussion of source monitoring literature (well-established aging research area)

**Score Justification:**

Strong basic theoretical rationale (2.5/3.0) but loses points for lack of literature grounding and minimal theoretical development. This is appropriate for a replication RQ but prevents full score.

---

#### 2. Literature Support (1.5 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [ ] Recent citations (2020-2024) provided (NONE - major gap)
- [ ] Seminal works (2010-2019) included (NONE)
- [x] Implicit coverage of established concepts (executive function, hippocampal decline, source monitoring)

**Assessment:**

This is the primary weakness. The concept.md contains **zero citations** despite making several literature-grounded claims:
- "Older adults show reduced executive function" (needs citation)
- "Age-related hippocampal decline affects spatial memory" (needs citation)
- Source vs destination distinction as theoretically meaningful construct (needs citation)

However, the claims made are **accurate** based on literature search validation (see Literature Search Results section below). The agent's validation confirms:
- Executive function decline in aging is well-established (multiple 2020-2024 sources found)
- Hippocampal contributions to spatial memory show age-related changes (Zheng et al. 2024 PNAS, among others)
- Source monitoring age differences are robust finding (established since 1980s, confirmed in 2020+ studies)

**Strengths:**
- Claims are accurate when checked against literature
- References established theoretical frameworks correctly (frontal lobe hypothesis, hippocampal decline)

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- No actual citations provided in concept.md
- Missing recent VR aging memory literature (2020-2024 has substantial work)
- Doesn't acknowledge source monitoring as distinct research area with established age effects

**Score Justification:**

Moderate score (1.5/2.0) - claims are theoretically sound but lack citation support. For a streamlined replication RQ, this is acceptable but not ideal for publication-quality work.

---

#### 3. Interpretation Guidelines (2.0 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Primary scenario covered (null 3-way interaction expected)
- [x] Alternative scenario acknowledged (if source-destination difference exists, age may modulate it)
- [x] Connection to theory (null result would support age-invariant forgetting in ecological VR)

**Assessment:**

Despite brevity, the concept.md provides clear interpretation guidance:
- **Primary prediction:** Null 3-way Age x Location Type x Time interaction (p > 0.05)
- **Rationale:** Consistent with universal null pattern across 5.1.3, 5.2.3, 5.3.4, 5.4.3
- **Theoretical implication:** Age-invariant forgetting in ecological VR encoding

This is appropriate for a replication RQ. The hypothesis is falsifiable (null can be rejected if age moderation found), and the expected result has clear interpretation (extends universal null pattern to source-destination distinction).

**Strengths:**
- Clear primary hypothesis (null 3-way interaction)
- Explicit connection to prior RQs (cross-validation logic)
- Transparent about expected result (null hypothesis testing)

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Doesn't specify what WOULD constitute meaningful age moderation (effect size thresholds)
- No discussion of how to interpret partial patterns (e.g., Age x Location Type without Time, or Age x Time without Location Type)

**Score Justification:**

Full score (2.0/2.0) - interpretation guidelines are clear and sufficient for this streamlined replication RQ. Results-inspector will know what to look for.

---

#### 4. Theoretical Implications (2.0 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Clear contribution stated (tests whether age-invariance extends to source-destination)
- [x] Implications specified (supports ecological VR assessment as age-fair)
- [x] Connection to broader research (VR memory assessment literature, aging research)

**Assessment:**

The concept.md articulates clear theoretical implications despite brevity:
- **Contribution:** Tests boundary conditions of universal null pattern (does it extend to source-destination?)
- **Implication (if null confirmed):** Age-invariant forgetting in ecological VR applies across multiple factor structures (domains, paradigms, congruence, AND source-destination)
- **Broader impact:** Supports VR memory tools as age-fair assessments (recent literature confirms ecological VR reduces age-related performance decrements)

**Strengths:**
- Clear falsifiable hypothesis (null can be rejected)
- Transparent replication logic (testing generalizability of pattern)
- Connects to practical implications (VR assessment fairness)

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Doesn't discuss what rejection of null would mean (would challenge universal pattern)
- No discussion of clinical relevance (source vs destination in aging assessment)

**Score Justification:**

Full score (2.0/2.0) - theoretical implications are clear and appropriate for replication RQ. Contributes to understanding boundary conditions of age-invariant forgetting.

### Scholarly Criticisms & Rebuttals

**Analysis Approach:**
- **Two-Pass WebSearch Strategy:**
  1. **Validation Pass:** Verified executive function, hippocampal, source-destination, and age-invariance claims (4 queries)
  2. **Challenge Pass:** Searched for counterevidence, preserved functions, methodological confounds (4 queries)
- **Focus:** Both commission errors (claims that may be wrong) and omission errors (missing critical context)
- **Grounding:** All criticisms cite specific 2020-2024 literature sources

---

#### Commission Errors (Critiques of Claims Made)

**1. Overgeneralized Hippocampal Decline Claim**
- **Location:** 1_concept.md - Theoretical Background, line 24
- **Claim Made:** "Age-related hippocampal decline affects spatial memory generally, but may show location-type specificity"
- **Scholarly Criticism:** This oversimplifies hippocampal aging. Recent high-resolution fMRI research shows TWO distinct mechanisms: one age-dependent (altered CA1 input) and one age-invariant (neural fidelity). Not all spatial memory decline is due to aging per se.
- **Counterevidence:** Zheng et al. (2024) *PNAS* demonstrated that older adults with better spatial discrimination show preserved neural fidelity in CA1 despite age-related input changes. Both young and older adults with greater signal fidelity show better spatial performance, suggesting individual differences matter as much as age.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "Revise to: 'Age-related changes in hippocampal CA1 input have been associated with spatial memory decline, though individual differences in neural fidelity appear age-invariant and may predict who ages well (Zheng et al., 2024).' This acknowledges complexity without undermining the hypothesis."

**2. Destination as Inherently More Demanding Assumption**
- **Location:** 1_concept.md - Theoretical Background, lines 23-24
- **Claim Made:** "Older adults show reduced executive function, which may differentially affect destination selection (requiring decision-making) vs source encoding (more automatic)"
- **Scholarly Criticism:** This assumes destination memory is more cognitively demanding than source memory, but empirical evidence doesn't consistently support this. Research shows destination and source memory have similar developmental trajectories and that destination is NOT particularly impaired by normal aging.
- **Counterevidence:** Gopie & Craik (2020) found in developmental research that destination memory accuracy correlates positively with source memory, and both show similar age-related patterns. Destination memory "needs not always be poorer than source memory" and "appears not to be particularly impaired by normal ageing."
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "Acknowledge that source vs destination may not differ in age-sensitivity as initially predicted. This actually STRENGTHENS the null hypothesis prediction - if they're equivalently demanding, age should affect both equally (or neither in ecological VR context)."

---

#### Omission Errors (Missing Context or Claims)

**1. No Discussion of Practice Effects in 4-Session Design**
- **Missing Content:** Concept.md doesn't acknowledge that participants complete the same test format 4 times (Days 0, 1, 3, 6), which creates practice effects that confound forgetting curves
- **Why It Matters:** Practice effects are substantial in longitudinal memory research, especially in first 3 months of repeated testing. This could mask age differences OR create spurious age-invariance if practice benefits older adults differentially
- **Supporting Literature:** Wilson et al. (2020) *Psychology & Aging* used measurement burst designs to show that "a substantial positive retest effect was obscuring stability in memory performance" in 5-year longitudinal study. Practice effects were "clinically relevant" (Cohen's d 0.36-1.19) during high-frequency testing.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "How do you distinguish genuine age-invariant forgetting from practice effects that might be masking age differences or benefiting older adults differentially?"
- **Strength:** CRITICAL
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Limitations or Notes section: 'The 4-session design (Days 0, 1, 3, 6) may introduce practice effects that confound forgetting trajectories. However, IRT theta scoring mitigates this by separating item difficulty from ability, and test session can be included as covariate in LMM if needed. Prior Chapter 5 RQs showed universal null age effects despite practice, suggesting pattern is robust.'"

**2. Source Monitoring as Established Aging Research Area Not Mentioned**
- **Missing Content:** No acknowledgment that "source monitoring" is a well-established research domain with decades of aging literature
- **Why It Matters:** Source monitoring age effects are one of the most robust findings in cognitive aging (Schacter et al., 1998 onwards). Not citing this literature makes the RQ appear less grounded than it actually is. The "universal null" in Chapter 5 would be MORE surprising given this established literature.
- **Supporting Literature:** Multiple reviews confirm source memory shows pronounced age-related decline while item memory is only moderately impaired (Johnson et al., 1993; Spencer & Raz, 1995; meta-analysis by Old & Naveh-Benjamin, 2008). Recent 2020+ studies replicate this pattern.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Given the robust literature on source memory age effects, why would you predict a null result here? What's different about your methodology?"
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Theoretical Background: 'Source monitoring typically shows pronounced age-related decline in traditional laboratory tasks (Schacter et al., 1998). However, recent VR research suggests ecological encoding contexts may attenuate these effects (Plancher et al., 2018), consistent with the age-invariance observed in RQs 5.1.3, 5.2.3, 5.3.4, 5.4.3.'"

**3. No Discussion of Ecological VR as Methodological Factor**
- **Missing Content:** Concept.md mentions "ecological VR encoding" produces age-invariant forgetting but doesn't explain WHY VR might differ from traditional lab tasks
- **Why It Matters:** The null hypothesis prediction relies on VR methodology being fundamentally different from traditional aging research. Recent literature explains this mechanism - ecological VR activates deeply experience-based encoding/retrieval strategies that are preserved in aging.
- **Supporting Literature:** Plancher et al. (2018) *Neuropsychology* found "ecologically valid VR-memory examination might provide a more accurate 'age-fair' estimation of everyday-life-related memory demands" because it activates "context-related automatic and effortless activations of deeply experience-based encoding strategies... which might not be paralleled by learning arbitrary word associations."
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Why should VR produce age-invariance when decades of lab research shows age effects? What's the mechanism?"
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Hypothesis rationale: 'Ecological VR encoding may reduce age-related performance decrements by activating preserved experience-based memory strategies (Plancher et al., 2018), explaining the universal null pattern across Chapter 5. Source-destination should follow this pattern if VR methodology is the key factor.'"

---

#### Alternative Theoretical Frameworks (Not Considered)

**1. Encoding Quality Hypothesis Not Addressed**
- **Alternative Theory:** The "universal null" for age effects might reflect ceiling/floor effects in encoding quality rather than true age-invariance in forgetting RATES. If older adults encode items less well initially (Day 0 baseline), they have less to forget - creating spurious appearance of parallel forgetting trajectories.
- **How It Applies:** Source vs destination might differ in INITIAL encoding quality (older adults encode source locations adequately but struggle with destination decisions during encoding). This would create baseline differences (Age x Location Type) without age-moderated forgetting (Age x Location Type x Time null).
- **Key Citation:** Bonnici et al. (2022) *Hippocampus* showed spatial context encoded with greater hippocampal engagement than temporal context in VR. If older adults have reduced hippocampal efficiency, initial encoding quality for destination decisions (requiring future-oriented planning) might be lower.
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** Reviewers will ask whether null 3-way interaction reflects (a) true age-invariant FORGETTING or (b) age-invariant forgetting that's masked by poor initial encoding creating floor effects
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** "Add to Interpretation section: 'If Age x Location Type x Time is null but Age x Location Type (without Time) is significant, this suggests age affects INITIAL encoding quality differently for source vs destination, but forgetting rates remain parallel. Day 0 baseline controls for this by establishing individual starting points before forgetting begins.'"

**2. Compensatory Strategy Hypothesis Not Discussed**
- **Alternative Theory:** Older adults may use different (compensatory) encoding strategies than younger adults in VR environments, leading to equivalent performance via different neural/cognitive mechanisms. The "universal null" might reflect successful compensation, not absence of underlying age-related decline.
- **How It Applies:** For source-destination specifically, older adults might compensate for executive function decline by relying on environmental regularities (source locations are fixed furniture) while struggling with destination decisions (variable choices). This creates age-invariant OUTCOMES via different PROCESSES.
- **Key Citation:** Raz et al. (2023) *Frontiers Aging Neuroscience* review notes "strategic monitoring less optimal in aging, but basic functions preserved." MacPherson et al. (2002) showed dorsolateral PFC tasks (like executive memory) show age effects in lab, but tasks with environmental support may not.
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** The null hypothesis is ambiguous: does it mean (a) no age differences in underlying processes OR (b) compensatory processes mask underlying decline?
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** "Add to Limitations: 'If null 3-way interaction found, this could reflect either (a) genuinely age-invariant forgetting in ecological contexts, or (b) compensatory strategies that produce equivalent outcomes via different processes. Memory strategy questionnaire data (Section 8 of each test) could help distinguish these possibilities post-hoc.'"

---

#### Known Methodological Confounds (Unaddressed)

**1. Latin Square Counterbalancing Doesn't Control Order Effects Across Time Points**
- **Confound Description:** The study uses Latin square counterbalancing such that "each test targeted one of the four VR rooms" across Days 0, 1, 3, 6. This means Test 1 (Day 0) always corresponds to Room 1, Test 2 (Day 1) to Room 2, etc. If older adults improve across sessions via general procedural learning (not item-specific), this creates Age x Test Session confound.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** If older adults show slower procedural learning curve than younger adults (learning how to take VR memory tests generally), early sessions (Day 0, Day 1) might show larger age differences than later sessions (Day 3, Day 6). This would create spurious Age x Time interaction OR mask true age differences if averaged across all timepoints.
- **Literature Evidence:** Wilson et al. (2020) found that practice effects in measurement burst designs were "most pronounced early on" (first 3 months). If older adults benefit MORE from practice than younger adults (narrowing initial gap), this could create false appearance of age-invariant forgetting.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** Source-destination comparisons happen WITHIN each test session. If older adults have higher task-general anxiety/unfamiliarity in early sessions, they might make more errors on destination decisions (executive-demanding) than source encoding (more automatic), creating Age x Location Type effect that DISAPPEARS across time as they habituate. This would be confounded with Age x Location Type x Time.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Analysis Approach: 'Control for test session as covariate in LMM to separate room-specific forgetting (Days 0->1->3->6 for SAME room) from procedural learning across rooms. If Age x Test Session significant, this suggests practice effects confound rather than true age-invariant forgetting.'"

**2. No Discussion of Individual Differences vs Age Trends**
- **Confound Description:** The study stratifies participants into 10 age bands (5-year bins from 20-70), treating age as continuous variable. But individual differences WITHIN age bands might be larger than differences BETWEEN age bands, especially in older adults (the "who will age well" question from Zheng et al. 2024).
- **How It Could Affect Results:** If there's substantial heterogeneity in older adult performance (some show decline, others preserved), aggregate analysis might show null age effect even if meaningful subgroups exist. For source-destination specifically, individuals with preserved executive function might show no source-destination difference, while those with executive decline show larger differences.
- **Literature Evidence:** Zheng et al. (2024) titled their paper "Spatial memory and hippocampal remapping: Who will age well?" emphasizing individual differences. They found neural fidelity predicts performance within both young and old groups, suggesting age is not the only factor.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** The null hypothesis assumes AGE is not a moderator. But this might be because the study design (healthy adults, pre-screened for cognitive impairment) excludes the individuals who WOULD show age effects. The "universal null" might be sample-selection artifact, not theoretical finding.
- **Strength:** MINOR (affects interpretation, not immediate analysis)
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Limitations: 'Participants were pre-screened for cognitive/neurological impairment, potentially restricting range and excluding older adults most likely to show age-related decline. Results generalize to healthy aging cohorts but may not reflect full spectrum of age-related cognitive changes. Individual differences analyses could reveal subgroups (e.g., high vs low executive function) that moderate source-destination differences even if age per se does not.'"

#### Scoring Summary

**Total Concerns Identified:**
- Commission Errors: 2 (0 CRITICAL, 2 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)
- Omission Errors: 3 (1 CRITICAL, 2 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)
- Alternative Frameworks: 2 (0 CRITICAL, 1 MODERATE, 1 MINOR)
- Methodological Confounds: 2 (0 CRITICAL, 1 MODERATE, 1 MINOR)

**Overall Devil's Advocate Assessment:**

The concept.md is theoretically sound but suffers from two main gaps: (1) complete absence of citations despite making literature-grounded claims, and (2) missing discussion of methodological factors (practice effects, VR methodology, sample selection) that explain WHY a null hypothesis is plausible given decades of source monitoring age-effects literature.

The agent's devil's advocate analysis identified critical omission (practice effects confound) and moderate theoretical issues (overgeneralized hippocampal/destination claims). These are addressable via targeted citations and brief methodological acknowledgment in Limitations/Notes.

Importantly, the CORE hypothesis (null Age x Location Type x Time) remains scientifically valid even with these criticisms. The replication logic is sound: if age-invariance extends to source-destination, this strengthens the "ecological VR as age-fair assessment" conclusion. The criticisms sharpen interpretation rather than undermining the RQ.

### Recommendations

#### Required Changes (Must Address for Approval)

**1. Add Critical Citations for Executive Function and Hippocampal Claims**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Theoretical Background, lines 23-25
   - **Issue:** Zero citations provided for age-related executive function decline and hippocampal changes, despite these being empirical claims requiring literature support
   - **Fix:** Add these citations:
     - Executive function: "Older adults show reduced executive function (Raz et al., 2023), which may differentially affect..."
     - Hippocampal: "Age-related changes in hippocampal CA1 input affect spatial memory (Zheng et al., 2024), though individual differences in neural fidelity appear age-invariant..."
   - **Rationale:** Scholarly rigor requires empirical claims to be cited. These 2024 sources are high-impact and directly support (while nuancing) the claims made.

**2. Acknowledge Practice Effects Confound**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - New section "Limitations" OR append to "Notes" section
   - **Issue:** The 4-session design (Days 0, 1, 3, 6) creates practice effects that could confound age x forgetting patterns, and this is not mentioned anywhere
   - **Fix:** Add 2-3 sentences: "The 4-session repeated-measures design may introduce practice effects that confound forgetting trajectories (Wilson et al., 2020). However, IRT theta scoring mitigates this by separating item difficulty from ability changes. The universal null pattern across prior age RQs (5.1.3, 5.2.3, 5.3.4, 5.4.3) suggests any practice effects do not differentially benefit age groups."
   - **Rationale:** Reviewers will immediately raise this concern. Proactively addressing it (with mitigation strategy) prevents criticism and demonstrates methodological sophistication.

---

#### Suggested Improvements (Optional but Recommended)

**1. Add Context for Why VR Might Produce Age-Invariance**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Hypothesis section, expand rationale
   - **Current:** "The universal null pattern for age effects suggests age-invariant forgetting in ecological VR encoding."
   - **Suggested:** "The universal null pattern suggests age-invariant forgetting in ecological VR encoding. This aligns with recent findings that ecological VR activates preserved experience-based memory strategies in older adults (Plancher et al., 2018), reducing age-related performance decrements observed in traditional laboratory tasks."
   - **Benefit:** Grounds the null hypothesis in mechanistic explanation rather than just empirical pattern. Helps reviewers understand WHY VR methodology matters.

**2. Reference Source Monitoring Literature Explicitly**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Theoretical Background, new paragraph
   - **Current:** No mention of source monitoring as established research domain
   - **Suggested:** Add paragraph: "Source monitoring - remembering the origin of information - is an established cognitive aging research area showing pronounced age-related decline in traditional laboratory tasks (Schacter et al., 1998). However, the null age effects across Chapter 5 RQs (domains, paradigms, congruence) suggest ecological VR methodology may attenuate these effects. RQ 5.5.3 tests whether this age-invariance extends to source (item pickup location) vs destination (item putdown location) comparisons."
   - **Benefit:** Demonstrates awareness of existing literature and positions the null hypothesis as theoretically interesting (contradicts traditional lab findings) rather than atheoretical replication.

**3. Clarify Interpretation for Partial Patterns**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Analysis Approach, add interpretation guidance
   - **Current:** Only states primary prediction (null 3-way interaction)
   - **Suggested:** Add scenario interpretations:
     - "If Age x Location Type significant WITHOUT Time: Age affects initial encoding quality for source vs destination differently, but forgetting rates parallel"
     - "If Age x Time significant WITHOUT Location Type: Age affects forgetting rates generally, not specific to source-destination distinction"
     - "If all interactions null: Age-invariant encoding AND forgetting for both source and destination"
   - **Benefit:** Provides clear interpretation logic for results-inspector and thesis Discussion section. Anticipates nuanced patterns.

**4. Acknowledge Sample Restriction as Potential Boundary Condition**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Limitations OR Notes section
   - **Current:** No mention of sample characteristics affecting generalizability
   - **Suggested:** Add sentence: "Participants were pre-screened for cognitive/neurological impairment (Methods 2.1), potentially restricting range and excluding older adults most likely to show age-related decline. Results generalize to healthy aging cohorts but may not reflect pathological aging."
   - **Benefit:** Demonstrates awareness of "who will age well" literature (Zheng et al., 2024) and prevents overgeneralization. Shows sophisticated understanding of boundary conditions.

### Decision

**Final Score:** 9.1 / 10.0

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL

**Threshold:** 9.0-9.24 (acceptable quality with minor gaps)

**Reasoning:**

This RQ demonstrates solid theoretical grounding and clear interpretation guidelines appropriate for a null-hypothesis replication study. The core scientific logic is sound: testing whether the universal null pattern for age effects (observed across domains, paradigms, congruence RQs) extends to source-destination comparisons.

However, two gaps prevent APPROVED status:
1. **Complete absence of citations** (0 cited) despite making empirical claims about executive function, hippocampal decline, and source-destination distinctions
2. **Missing discussion of practice effects** - a critical methodological confound in 4-session repeated-measures design

These are readily addressable via targeted citations and brief methodological acknowledgment (2-3 sentences). The theoretical framework is accurate (validated via literature search), it simply needs formal citation support.

The streamlined format is appropriate for a replication RQ, but publication-quality work requires citing empirical claims and acknowledging known confounds even in brief specifications.

**Next Steps:**

**⚠️ CONDITIONAL (9.0-9.24):**
- Address 2 required changes listed above (add citations, acknowledge practice effects)
- No re-validation required - proceed after changes implemented
- Master can verify changes or proceed with planning if changes are minor editorial additions

Suggested improvements are optional but strongly recommended for thesis publication quality. Adding VR methodology context and source monitoring literature positioning would strengthen scholarly impact without requiring substantive revision.
