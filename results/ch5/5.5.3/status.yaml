    RQ 5.5.3: Age Effects on Source-Destination Memory
    Type: Source-Destination / Age Effects
    Analysis: LMM with 3-way Age x LocationType x Time interactions
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.5.1 (theta scores by location type)
    Critical: Null hypothesis - age will NOT moderate source-destination difference

rq_scholar:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.3/10 APPROVED. Theory strong (age-invariance theoretically motivated), lit needs 2020-24 cites, 4 critical concerns (age range, practice effects, dropout bias, hippocampal mechanism). Ready for rq_stats."

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.6/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 3.0/3 (optimal LMM, justified complexity, null hypothesis power analysis). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% tools). Cat3: 2.0/2 (all parameters specified). Cat4: 2.0/2 (7 assumption checks, gold standard). Cat5: 0.6/1 (7 concerns, adequate but could be more comprehensive). 1 CRITICAL concern (random slope convergence N=100), 5 MODERATE concerns. No required changes. Power analysis for null hypothesis is exemplary."

    Analysis plan created: 6 steps (Step 0: dependency loading + Steps 1-5: analysis).
    Tool requirements: LMM with 3-way interactions, power analysis (1000 simulations), assumption validation (7 checks), post-hoc contrasts (Tukey HSD).
    Expected outputs: 15 data files (theta/TSVR/Age from RQ 5.5.1, LMM model, interactions, power, contrasts, plot data). Validation mandatory at every step.

    All 8 analysis steps executed successfully:
    - step00: Loaded dependency data from RQ 5.5.1 (400 theta, 400 TSVR, 100 Age)
    - step01: Prepared LMM input (800 rows = 400 x 2 locations)
    - step02: Fit LMM with 3-way Age x LocationType x Time (12 fixed effects, converged)
    - step02.5: Validated assumptions (6/7 passed = 86%)
    - step03: Extracted 3-way interactions (p=0.16, 0.33 Bonferroni)
    - step03.5: Power analysis (power=1.00 for small effects)
    - step04: Post-hoc contrasts (age effect diff=-0.0003, p=0.99)
    - step05: Prepared plot data (24 rows: 3 tertiles x 2 locations x 4 tests)

    All outputs validated:
    - Data files: 17 CSV files with expected row counts and value ranges
    - Model: Converged, 12 fixed effects, positive variances
    - Results: 3-way interactions NOT significant (null hypothesis supported)
    - Power: 1.00 (adequately powered for null finding interpretation)

    - age_tertile_trajectory_probability.png (probability scale with factor-specific conversion)
    - age_tertile_dual_scale.png (2x2 combined view)
    All plots show age tertiles (Young/Middle/Older) for Source and Destination memory
    Visual confirms null finding: similar trajectories across age groups
