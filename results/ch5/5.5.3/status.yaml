    RQ 5.5.3: Age Effects on Source-Destination Memory
    Type: Source-Destination / Age Effects
    Analysis: LMM with 3-way Age x LocationType x Time interactions
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.5.1 (theta scores by location type)
    Critical: Null hypothesis - age will NOT moderate source-destination difference

rq_scholar:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.3/10 APPROVED. Theory strong (age-invariance theoretically motivated), lit needs 2020-24 cites, 4 critical concerns (age range, practice effects, dropout bias, hippocampal mechanism). Ready for rq_stats."

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.6/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 3.0/3 (optimal LMM, justified complexity, null hypothesis power analysis). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% tools). Cat3: 2.0/2 (all parameters specified). Cat4: 2.0/2 (7 assumption checks, gold standard). Cat5: 0.6/1 (7 concerns, adequate but could be more comprehensive). 1 CRITICAL concern (random slope convergence N=100), 5 MODERATE concerns. No required changes. Power analysis for null hypothesis is exemplary."

    Analysis plan created: 6 steps (Step 0: dependency loading + Steps 1-5: analysis).
    Tool requirements: LMM with 3-way interactions, power analysis (1000 simulations), assumption validation (7 checks), post-hoc contrasts (Tukey HSD).
    Expected outputs: 15 data files (theta/TSVR/Age from RQ 5.5.1, LMM model, interactions, power, contrasts, plot data). Validation mandatory at every step.
