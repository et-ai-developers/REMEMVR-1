[START] Step 05: Prepare Age Tertile Plot Data
[LOAD] Loading LMM input data...
[LOADED] 800 observations
[TERTILE] Computing age tertile cutoffs...
[CUTOFF] 33rd percentile: 36.7 years
[CUTOFF] 67th percentile: 52.3 years
[ASSIGN] Assigning observations to age tertiles...
[COUNTS] Participants per tertile:
  Young: 33 participants
  Middle: 34 participants
  Older: 33 participants
[AGGREGATE] Computing means and CIs by group...
[RESULT] 24 groups created
[VALIDATION] Running validation checks...
[PASS] Row count = 24
[PASS] All 3 age tertiles present
[PASS] Both locations present
[PASS] All 4 tests present
[PASS] No NaN values
[PASS] Confidence intervals valid
[PASS] Minimum group size = 33 (>= 5)
[SAVE] Saving plot data...
[SAVED] step05_age_tertile_plot_data.csv (24 rows)
[SUMMARY] Theta means by age tertile and location:
  Middle - Destination: -0.070
  Middle - Source: -0.201
  Older - Destination: 0.006
  Older - Source: -0.063
  Young - Destination: 0.134
  Young - Source: 0.202
[SUCCESS] Step 05 complete - Plot data prepared
