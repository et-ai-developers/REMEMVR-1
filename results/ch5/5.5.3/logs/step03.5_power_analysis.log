[START] Step 03.5: Power Analysis for Null Hypothesis Testing
[LOAD] Loading model and data...
[LOADED] Model and data (800 observations)
[EXTRACT] Extracting variance components...
[VARIANCE] Random intercept var: 0.2120
[VARIANCE] Residual var: 0.3967
[POWER] Running power analysis...
  Effect size: 0.01
  N simulations: 100
  Alpha (Bonferroni): 0.025
[RESULT] Power = 1.000 (95% CI: [0.970, 1.000])
[RESULT] Target (0.80): MET
[SAVE] Saving power analysis results...
[SAVED] step03.5_power_analysis.csv
[VALIDATION] Validating results...
[PASS] Power in valid range [0, 1]
[PASS] n_detected <= n_simulations
[INTERPRETATION]
  Power >= 0.80: Study adequately powered to detect small effects
  Null finding is INTERPRETABLE: Age truly does not moderate effect
[CONTEXT] Effect size interpretation:
  The observed 3-way interaction coefficients are:
    TSVR_hours:Age_c:LocationType: -0.000185 (essentially zero)
    log_TSVR:Age_c:LocationType: 0.005151 (very small)
  Even with limited power, coefficients this close to zero
  suggest the null hypothesis is substantively supported.
[SUCCESS] Step 03.5 complete - Power analysis finished
