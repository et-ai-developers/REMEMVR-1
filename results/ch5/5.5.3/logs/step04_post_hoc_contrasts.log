[INTERPRETATION]
  Age effects at Day 3 are similar for both location types:
    Destination: -0.005329 theta units per year
    Source: -0.005031 theta units per year
    Difference: -0.000299 (p=0.9902)
  Neither age effect is significantly different from zero
  and the contrast is not significant.
  This supports the null hypothesis: age does NOT differentially
  affect source vs destination memory.
[SUCCESS] Step 04 complete - Post-hoc contrasts computed
