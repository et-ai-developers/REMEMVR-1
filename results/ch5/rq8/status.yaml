    Domains: All three WWW (inherited from RQ 5.7, collapsed across domains)

    Analysis: LMM (3 convergent tests - quadratic term, piecewise vs continuous AIC,
    slope ratio)

    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.7 (theta scores, TSVR mapping, best continuous model)

    Critical: Tests consolidation theory inflection at Day 1 (48h TSVR). Requires
    RQ 5.7 complete.

    Analysis plan created: 7 steps planned (Step 0: data loading + Steps 1-6: analysis and visualization).
    Tool requirements: LMM trajectory modeling (quadratic, piecewise), comprehensive assumption validation, slope extraction, plot data preparation.
    Expected outputs: 10+ files (2 model summaries, predictions CSVs, assumption validation report, slope comparison, plot source CSV).
    Cross-RQ dependency: RQ 5.7 (theta scores, TSVR mapping, best continuous model).
    Validation required at every step (6 analysis steps, all with 4-layer substance criteria).

    Generated code for all 7 steps (step00-step06).
    Bugs fixed: 3 (Step 0 file references, Steps 2-3 API mismatch fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr→fit_lmm_trajectory, Step 3 DataFrame.data + missing pickle save).
    Steps 0-3, 6 executed successfully. Steps 4-5 failed due to tool bugs (validate_lmm_assumptions_comprehensive.get_influence() missing, extract_segment_slopes_from_lmm coefficient name mismatch).
    Key outputs: step00_theta_tsvr.csv (400 rows), step02_quadratic_model.pkl (AIC=940.32), step03_piecewise_model.pkl (AIC=878.74, deltaAIC=+5.03 favors continuous), step06_piecewise_comparison_data.csv (33 rows plot source).
    Main finding: Continuous model favored over piecewise (deltaAIC>+2) - evidence AGAINST two-phase forgetting hypothesis.
