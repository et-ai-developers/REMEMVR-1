    RQ 5.8: Two-phase forgetting (rapid then slow)
    Domains: All three WWW (inherited from RQ 5.7, collapsed across domains)
    Analysis: LMM (3 convergent tests - quadratic term, piecewise vs continuous AIC, slope ratio)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.7 (theta scores, TSVR mapping, best continuous model)
    Critical: Tests consolidation theory inflection at Day 1 (48h TSVR). Requires RQ 5.7 complete.

    5.8 validated: 9.3/10 APPROVED. Strong consolidation theory, 5 suggested lit additions (Radvansky 2022 high priority). 10 moderate concerns identified. Ready for stats.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.1/10 CONDITIONAL. Cat1: 2.8/3 (triangulation strong, breakpoint bias concern). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 1.9/2 (well-specified, slope ratio unjustified). Cat4: 1.7/2 (comprehensive, missing sensitivity). Cat5: 0.7/1 (8 concerns, uneven). Address breakpoint bias + sensitivity."
