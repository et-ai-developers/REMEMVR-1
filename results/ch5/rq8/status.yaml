    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.7 (theta scores, TSVR mapping, best continuous model)

    Critical: Tests consolidation theory inflection at Day 1 (48h TSVR). Requires

    Analysis plan created: 7 steps planned (Step 0: data loading + Steps 1-6: analysis and visualization).
    Tool requirements: LMM trajectory modeling (quadratic, piecewise), comprehensive assumption validation, slope extraction, plot data preparation.
    Expected outputs: 10+ files (2 model summaries, predictions CSVs, assumption validation report, slope comparison, plot source CSV).
    Cross-RQ dependency: RQ 5.7 (theta scores, TSVR mapping, best continuous model).
    Validation required at every step (6 analysis steps, all with 4-layer substance criteria).
