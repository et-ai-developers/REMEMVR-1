    Created results/ch5/rq8/ with 6 folders
    Folders: docs/, data/, code/, logs/, plots/, results/
    All folders empty, ready for agents
    status.yaml initialized with 10 RQ-specific agents
    Next: rq_concept extracts concept from thesis

rq_concept:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    RQ 5.8: Two-phase forgetting (rapid then slow)
    Domains: All three WWW (inherited from RQ 5.7, collapsed across domains)
    Analysis: LMM (3 convergent tests - quadratic term, piecewise vs continuous AIC, slope ratio)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.7 (theta scores, TSVR mapping, best continuous model)
    Critical: Tests consolidation theory inflection at Day 1 (48h TSVR). Requires RQ 5.7 complete.

    5.8 validated: 9.3/10 APPROVED. Strong consolidation theory, 5 suggested lit additions (Radvansky 2022 high priority). 10 moderate concerns identified. Ready for stats.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.1/10 CONDITIONAL. Cat1: 2.8/3 (triangulation strong, breakpoint bias concern). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 1.9/2 (well-specified, slope ratio unjustified). Cat4: 1.7/2 (comprehensive, missing sensitivity). Cat5: 0.7/1 (8 concerns, uneven). Address breakpoint bias + sensitivity."

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    7 steps planned (Step 0: Get Data, Steps 1-6: Analysis + Visualization)
    LMM-only analysis (no IRT - uses DERIVED theta from RQ 5.7)
    3 convergent tests: quadratic term, piecewise vs continuous AIC, Early/Late slope ratio
    Expected outputs: Quadratic model, piecewise model, assumption validation, slope comparison, plot source CSV
    Validation: Per-step mandatory (4-layer substance criteria)

rq_tools:
  status: fail
  context_dump: |
    FAIL: Missing analysis tool in tools_inventory.md
    Step 5 requires: extract_segment_slopes_from_lmm (piecewise segment slope extraction with delta method SE)
    Currently available: extract_fixed_effects_from_lmm (generic fixed effects only, no segment-specific logic)
    Step 4 tool NOW AVAILABLE: validate_lmm_assumptions_comprehensive (FOUND in tools_inventory.md line 245)
    Action: User + Claude create extract_segment_slopes_from_lmm with TDD -> Update tools_inventory.md -> Re-run rq_tools
