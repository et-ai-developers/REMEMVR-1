    Folders: docs/, data/, code/, logs/, plots/, results/
    All folders empty, ready for agents

    RQ 5.8: Two-phase forgetting (rapid then slow)
    Domains: All three WWW (inherited from RQ 5.7, collapsed across domains)
    Analysis: LMM (3 convergent tests - quadratic term, piecewise vs continuous AIC, slope ratio)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.7 (theta scores, TSVR mapping, best continuous model)
    Critical: Tests consolidation theory inflection at Day 1 (48h TSVR). Requires RQ 5.7 complete.

    5.8 validated: 9.3/10 APPROVED. Strong consolidation theory, 5 suggested lit additions (Radvansky 2022 high priority). 10 moderate concerns identified. Ready for stats.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.1/10 CONDITIONAL. Category 1: 2.7/3 (appropriate triangulation, convergence risk unacknowledged). Category 2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Category 3: 1.8/2 (random structure underspecified). Category 4: 1.8/2 (assumption validation missing). Category 5: 0.8/1 (7 concerns, good coverage, commission subsection thin)."
