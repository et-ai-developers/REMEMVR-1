    RQ 5.4.7: Schema-Based Clustering
    Type: Congruence / Schema-Based Clustering
    Analysis: K-means clustering (K=1-6, BIC selection)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.6 random effects (100 x 6 features)
    Critical: Congruence-specific profiles, cluster sizes >= 10%

    RQ 5.4.7 validated: 9.4/10 APPROVED. Schema theory + methodology sound. 3 omissions (practice effects, VR sickness dropout, sleep consolidation dynamics) addressable via brief Limitations section. 8-12 recent citations to add. Ready for rq_stats.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.5/10.0 APPROVED (re-validated 2025-12-02). Cat 1: 2.8/3 (K-means vs LPA justified, sphericity addressed). Cat 2: 2.0/2 (100% tool reuse). Cat 3: 1.9/2 (silhouette/Davies-Bouldin/Jaccard thresholds). Cat 4: 2.0/2 (bootstrap stability+quality metrics). Cat 5: 0.9/1 (57% devil's advocate resolution). All CONDITIONAL requirements met. SUGGESTED: BIC tie-breaking, Ben-David criterion, correlation validation.

rq_planner:

  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 7 steps (Step 0: extraction + Steps 1-6: clustering).
    Tool requirements: K-means clustering, BIC selection, bootstrap stability, cluster characterization, plot data preparation.
    Expected outputs: 10 data files (random effects, standardized features, cluster assignments/centers, quality metrics, plot source CSV), 7 logs. Validation required at every step.

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    7 analysis + 6 validation tools cataloged for K-means clustering analysis
    All sklearn tools exempt (StandardScaler, KMeans, silhouette_score, davies_bouldin_score)
    All validation tools verified in tool_inventory.md (validate_dataframe_structure, validate_standardization, validate_cluster_assignment, validate_bootstrap_stability, validate_cluster_summary_stats, validate_plot_data_completeness)
    Quality thresholds: Silhouette >= 0.40, Davies-Bouldin < 1.5, Jaccard > 0.75, cluster size >= 10
