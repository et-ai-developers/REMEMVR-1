    RQ 5.4.7: Schema-Based Clustering
    Type: Congruence / Schema-Based Clustering
    Analysis: K-means clustering (K=1-6, BIC selection)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.6 random effects (100 x 6 features)
    Critical: Congruence-specific profiles, cluster sizes >= 10%

    RQ 5.4.7 validated: 9.4/10 APPROVED. Schema theory + methodology sound. 3 omissions (practice effects, VR sickness dropout, sleep consolidation dynamics) addressable via brief Limitations section. 8-12 recent citations to add. Ready for rq_stats.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.5/10.0 APPROVED (re-validated 2025-12-02). Cat 1: 2.8/3 (K-means vs LPA justified, sphericity addressed). Cat 2: 2.0/2 (100% tool reuse). Cat 3: 1.9/2 (silhouette/Davies-Bouldin/Jaccard thresholds). Cat 4: 2.0/2 (bootstrap stability+quality metrics). Cat 5: 0.9/1 (57% devil's advocate resolution). All CONDITIONAL requirements met. SUGGESTED: BIC tie-breaking, Ben-David criterion, correlation validation.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 7 steps (Step 0: extraction + Steps 1-6: clustering).
    Tool requirements: K-means clustering, BIC selection, bootstrap stability, cluster characterization, plot data preparation.
    Expected outputs: 10 data files (random effects, standardized features, cluster assignments/centers, quality metrics, plot source CSV), 7 logs. Validation required at every step.

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    7 analysis + 6 validation tools cataloged for K-means clustering analysis
    All sklearn tools exempt (StandardScaler, KMeans, silhouette_score, davies_bouldin_score)
    All validation tools verified in tool_inventory.md (validate_dataframe_structure, validate_standardization, validate_cluster_assignment, validate_bootstrap_stability, validate_cluster_summary_stats, validate_plot_data_completeness)
    Quality thresholds: Silhouette >= 0.40, Davies-Bouldin < 1.5, Jaccard > 0.75, cluster size >= 10

rq_inspect:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Validated all 7 analysis steps (step00-step06) for RQ 5.4.7
    All outputs verified: 106 rows (100 participants + 6 cluster centers), 10 columns, K=6 clusters
    Quality metrics documented: silhouette=0.254, Jaccard=0.592 (below thresholds = weak clustering, acceptable null finding)
    All layers PASS: Existence, Structure, Substance, Execution logs clean

rq_plots:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    3 plots generated: bic_elbow.png, cluster_profiles.png, cluster_scatter_matrix.png
    K=6 clusters visualized, 3x3 scatter matrix (intercepts only - slopes ~0)
    Weak clustering quality documented: silhouette=0.254, Jaccard=0.592

  timestamp: "2025-12-09T00:00:00Z"
  context_dump: |
    Results validated for scientific plausibility (MODEL-AVERAGED UPDATE)
    K=6 clusters REPLICATED across Log-only (Dec 3) and Model-averaged (Dec 9) analyses
    WEAK clustering quality ROBUST: silhouette=0.236, Jaccard=0.587 (similar to Log-only 0.254, 0.592)
    Summary documented in results/summary_model_averaged.md (comparison to Log-only included)
    CRITICAL FINDING: Adding meaningful slope variance (Model-averaged) did NOT improve clustering quality - NULL finding confirmed
