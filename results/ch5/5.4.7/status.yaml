    RQ 5.4.7: Schema-Based Clustering
    Type: Congruence / Schema-Based Clustering
    Analysis: K-means clustering (K=1-6, BIC selection)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.6 random effects (100 x 6 features)
    Critical: Congruence-specific profiles, cluster sizes >= 10%

    RQ 5.4.7 validated: 9.4/10 APPROVED. Schema theory + methodology sound. 3 omissions (practice effects, VR sickness dropout, sleep consolidation dynamics) addressable via brief Limitations section. 8-12 recent citations to add. Ready for rq_stats.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.5/10.0 APPROVED (re-validated 2025-12-02). Cat 1: 2.8/3 (K-means vs LPA justified, sphericity addressed). Cat 2: 2.0/2 (100% tool reuse). Cat 3: 1.9/2 (silhouette/Davies-Bouldin/Jaccard thresholds). Cat 4: 2.0/2 (bootstrap stability+quality metrics). Cat 5: 0.9/1 (57% devil's advocate resolution). All CONDITIONAL requirements met. SUGGESTED: BIC tie-breaking, Ben-David criterion, correlation validation.
