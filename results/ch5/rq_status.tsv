RQ	Type	Status	Model_Form	Gaps	Next_Action	Effort	Priority	Blocks	Dependencies	Validation	Notes
5.1.1	General/ROOT	GOLD	PowerLaw α=0.410 (16 models averaged)	-	Document model averaging methodology in thesis Methods	1day	HIGH	5.1.2,5.1.3,5.1.4,5.1.5	-	PASS	Extended 66-model + averaging complete. ΔAIC=3.10 vs Log. Ebbinghaus→Wixted paradigm shift.
5.1.2	General/Two-Phase	GOLD	Lin+Log (piecewise) + Practice decomposition (Step 7)	-	None (practice decomposition complete)	0	DONE	-	5.1.1	PASS	Two-phase pattern confirmed BUT reinterpreted: Practice saturation (5.7x difference T1→T2 vs T2→T4, p<0.000002) explains deceleration more than consolidation. Practice decomposition (Step 7, 2025-12-09) reveals retrieval practice PARTIALLY masks forgetting. Methodological contribution: Dual-phase model applicable to all repeated-measures designs.
5.1.3	General/Age	GOLD	Model-Averaged (40 functional forms, N_eff=10.1) + Practice decomposition (Step 3)	-	None (extended + practice decomposition complete)	0	DONE	-	5.1.1	PASS	ROBUST NULL age effects (all p>0.48). Extended 66-model comparison: SquareRoot+Lin best (9.9% weight). Model averaging resolves wrong-direction artifacts. Practice decomposition (Step 3, 2025-12-09): Age-invariant practice effects (Age×Phase p=0.41) - wrong-direction NOT explained by differential practice. VR Scaffolding Hypothesis STRENGTHENED: Immersive context compensates for hippocampal aging AND equalizes practice benefits across ages. REVERSES original interpretation (marginal→robust NULL). LIMITATION: Age range [20-70] with only 7 participants ≥65 may not capture critical hippocampal aging (70+); generalizability to older old adults uncertain.
5.1.4	General/Variance	GOLD	Model-Averaged (10 PowerLaw models, N_eff=9.84)	-	None (model averaging complete)	0	DONE	5.1.5	5.1.1	PASS	ICC_slope=21.6% (forgetting IS trait-like, 432× larger than Lin+Log single model). Model averaging MANDATORY (best weight 5.7%). REVERSES original NULL finding.
5.1.5	General/Clustering	GOLD	Model-Averaged (via 5.1.4 step06, K=3)	-	None (model averaging complete)	0	DONE	5.1.6	5.1.4	PASS	K=3 (elbow, K=1-10 extended). Jaccard=0.293 (UNSTABLE, model-averaged uncertainty), Silhouette=0.408 (WEAK but improved +20%). 3 clusters: Low/stable (25%), High/declining (44%), Avg/improving (31%). Bidirectional trajectories revealed. LIMITATION: Bootstrap instability (Jaccard=0.293) and K-selection range dependency (K=2 with K=1-6 vs K=3 with K=1-10); weak cluster structure expected with model averaging uncertainty.
5.1.6	General/ItemDiff	DEPRIORITIZED	-	-	None (answered by 5.3.9)	-	-	-	-	-	Answered by 5.3.9 paradigm-invariant item difficulty. Expected NULL. Directory exists as ".5.1.6" (hidden/incomplete).
5.2.1	Domains/ROOT	GOLD	Recip+Log (10 models averaged)	-	Check derivatives for ROOT dependency updates	0	DONE	5.2.2,5.2.3,5.2.4,5.2.5,5.2.6,5.2.7	-	PASS	Extended 66-model + averaging complete. Two-process forgetting (rapid 1/(t+1) + slow log(t+1)). When domain excluded (floor effect).
5.2.2	Domains/Consolidation	GOLD	Log (piecewise)	-	None (plots current)	0	DONE	-	5.2.1 (weak)	PASS	NULL differential consolidation (p=0.938, 2-domain analysis). Plots current (regenerated 2025-12-09, What/Where only). General consolidation EXISTS (5-6× steeper Early slopes), but domain-general (not spatially selective).
5.2.3	Domains/Age	GOLD	Recip+Log (ROOT-verified)	-	None (ROOT verification complete)	0	DONE	-	5.2.1	PASS	NULL age effects ROBUST (p_bonf>0.025 with both Log and Recip+Log). Step 02d verification: ΔAIC=-83.07 (Recip+Log better fit), ~recip_TSVR random slopes converged, 3-way interactions remain NULL. Domain-general age effects confirmed.
5.2.4	Domains/IRT-CTT	GOLD	Recip+Log (ROOT-verified)	-	None (ROOT verification complete)	0	DONE	-	5.2.1	PASS	r=0.87-0.91 EXCEPTIONAL and ROBUST (unchanged with Recip+Log). Step 03b verification: Convergence model-invariant (r identical for Log vs Recip+Log). CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Recip+Log reveals CTT CAN detect individual differences (Var: 0.000→0.022), Log-only boundary was model limitation. IRT still superior (68× more variance: 1.507 vs 0.022) but both methods benefit from two-process forgetting.
5.2.5	Domains/PurifiedCTT	GOLD	Recip+Log (ROOT-verified)	-	None (ROOT verification complete)	0	DONE	-	5.2.1	PASS	Purification-Trajectory Paradox ROBUST and AMPLIFIED. Step 07b verification: Log-only (Purified CTT worst fit ΔAIC=+157), Recip+Log (Purified CTT CANNOT CONVERGE - singular matrix). CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Complex functional forms expose inadequate item sampling. Better correlation (Δr=+0.015-0.027) but increasingly problematic trajectory modeling. Purification adequate for static screening, inadequate for two-process forgetting dynamics.
5.2.6	Domains/Variance	GOLD	Model-Averaged (10 PowerLaw models, N_eff=9.64, stratified)	-	None (model averaging complete)	0	DONE	5.2.7	5.2.1	PASS	ICC_slope What=16.5%, Where=22.8% (15-29× larger than Log-only). Model averaging MANDATORY (best weight 6.4%). Dual-process pattern: Where > What (hippocampal stability). FEEDS 5.2.7 (200 model-averaged random effects).
5.2.7	Domains/Clustering	GOLD	Model-Averaged (via 5.2.6 step08, K=4)	-	None (model averaging complete)	0	DONE	-	5.2.6,5.2.1	PASS	K=4 (parsimony rule, ΔBIC<2). Silhouette=0.352 (POOR but improved +3.5%), Jaccard=0.871 (STABLE). Model-averaged slopes reveal trait variance (ICC_slope 16-23%). 4 clusters: Average/Fast, Average/Improving, Low/Dissociated, High/Stable.
5.2.8	Domains/ItemDiff	DEPRIORITIZED	-	-	None (answered by 5.3.9)	-	-	-	-	-	Answered by 5.3.9 paradigm-invariant NULL. Expected NULL. User decision: Paradigm-level generalizes to domain-level.
5.3.1	Paradigms/ROOT	GOLD	PowerLaw α=0.140 (14 models averaged)	-	None (ΔAIC=0.07 negligible, derivatives OK)	0	DONE	-	-	PASS	Extended 66-model + averaging complete. Log/PowerLaw TIED (ΔAIC=0.07). NO RERUN NEEDED for derivatives (minimal impact).
5.3.2	Paradigms/Gradient	COMPLETE	Log	Effect_Size_Optional	Optional: Add effect size interpretation statement	15min	DONE	-	5.3.1	PASS	Linear trend IFR<ICR<IRE (p=0.013 uncorr, p=0.200 Bonf). Recognition FASTEST forgetting (contradicts hypothesis). Dual p-value reporting (D068) exemplary.
5.3.3	Paradigms/Consolidation	COMPLETE	Log (piecewise)	-	None	0	DONE	-	5.3.1	PASS	NULL differential consolidation (0/6 contrasts significant, p_bonf>0.16). Cued Recall greatest benefit (+0.298, unexpected but ns). 3 bugs fixed.
5.3.4	Paradigms/Age	COMPLETE	Log	-	None	0	DONE	-	5.3.1	PASS	NULL 3-way Age×Paradigm×Time (all p>0.7, p_bonf=1.0). CRITICAL FIX (2025-12-03): Random slope corrected to ~log_TSVR (Var 7.75× larger).
5.3.5	Paradigms/IRT-CTT	COMPLETE	Log	-	None	0	DONE	-	5.3.1	PASS	r=0.84-0.88, κ=0.667 (SUBSTANTIAL). Validates 5.3.1 not IRT artifact. ZERO required fixes. Both IRT and CTT LMMs converged with random slopes.
5.3.6	Paradigms/PurifiedCTT	COMPLETE	Log	-	None	0	DONE	-	5.3.1	PASS	Purification-Trajectory Paradox (3rd replication). IFR Δr=+0.098***, ICR Δr=+0.023*, IRE Δr=+0.050***. But AIC WORSE (IFR -33.4, ICR -5.3, IRE -6.8).
5.3.7	Paradigms/Variance	COMPLETE	Log	-	None	0	DONE	-	5.3.1	PASS	ICC_int=0.44-0.52 (Substantial). ICC_slope=0.000-0.022 (Design limitation). Replicates 5.2.6/5.4.6 pattern. Feeds 5.3.8 (300 random effects).
5.3.8	Paradigms/Clustering	COMPLETE	Log (via 5.3.7)	-	None	0	DONE	-	5.3.7,5.3.1	PASS	K=3 (BIC). WEAK: silhouette=0.367 (<0.40), Jaccard=0.714 (marginal). No paradigm-selective memory phenotypes (meaningful NULL).
5.3.9	Paradigms/ItemDiff	COMPLETE	Log (GLMM)	-	None	0	DONE	-	5.3.1	PASS	3-way NULL (p_bonf>0.0033). Paradigm-invariant item difficulty. 18k observations (cross-classified GLMM). Answers 5.1.6, 5.2.8, 5.4.8.
5.4.1	Congruence/ROOT	GOLD	Recip+Log hybrid (15 models, N_eff=13.96)	-	None (extended complete)	0	DONE	5.4.2,5.4.3,5.4.4,5.4.5,5.4.6,5.4.7	-	PASS	Extended 66-model + averaging complete. Recip+Log 73.7% (17-model), 6.0% (66-model). EXTREME uncertainty (15 competitive models). NULL schema effects.
5.4.2	Congruence/Consolidation	GOLD	PowerLaw α=0.181 (15 models averaged, piecewise preserved)	-	None (extended comparison complete)	0	DONE	-	5.4.1	PASS	NULL consolidation ROBUST across 66 models (p=0.938, all functional forms). Extended comparison: PowerLaw_01 6.04% (EXTREME uncertainty, N_eff=13.96). Model averaging MANDATORY. Piecewise preserved (better AIC with random slopes). Random effects matter MORE than functional form.
5.4.3	Congruence/Age	GOLD	Recip+Log two-process	-	None (updated to Recip+Log)	0	DONE	-	5.4.1	PASS	NULL 3-way ROBUST (0/4 interactions p_bonf>0.025, 0/3 Tukey p=1.0). Updated to Recip+Log with ~recip_TSVR random slopes. Two-process forgetting: rapid (β=-1.21) + slow (β=-0.34), both age-invariant across schema levels.
5.4.4	Congruence/IRT-CTT	GOLD	Recip+Log two-process	-	None (updated to Recip+Log)	0	DONE	-	5.4.1	PASS	r=0.875-0.907 (EXCEPTIONAL), κ=1.00 (PERFECT agreement, upgraded from 0.667 with Recip+Log). Convergence ROBUST across functional forms. Two-process forgetting: rapid (recip_TSVR) + slow (log_TSVR), both ~recip_TSVR slopes.
5.4.5	Congruence/PurifiedCTT	GOLD	Recip+Log two-process	-	None (updated to Recip+Log)	0	DONE	-	5.4.1	PASS	Purification-Trajectory Paradox ROBUST across functional forms. Recip+Log: Common ΔAIC=+19.0 (Log +17.2), Congruent ΔAIC=+38.2 (Log +35.2), Incongruent ΔAIC=+0.4 TIED (Log -2.0). Paradox STRENGTHENED for Common/Congruent (+1.8, +3.0), REVERSED for Incongruent (now tied). Correlation findings unchanged (Δr=+0.022 ns, +0.096***, +0.108***).
5.4.6	Congruence/Variance	GOLD	Model-Averaged (6 models, N_eff=5.94)	-	None (model averaging complete, plots/results regenerated)	0	DONE	5.4.7	5.4.1	PASS	ICC_slope: Common=0.148, Congruent=0.078, Incongruent=0.036 (LOG UNDERESTIMATED 85-95%). Model averaging MANDATORY (RQ 5.4.1 6% weight). Feeds 5.4.7 (300 model-averaged random effects).
5.4.7	Congruence/Clustering	GOLD	Model-Averaged (6D: intercepts+slopes, K=6)	-	None (model-averaged clustering complete, plots/results regenerated)	0	DONE	-	5.4.6,5.4.1	PASS	K=6 (BIC boundary, replicated). WEAK: silhouette=0.236, Jaccard=0.587 (meaningful NULL - no schema-selective phenotypes). Model-averaged slopes (0.02-0.12) contribute to clustering but weak quality persists (robust NULL finding).
5.4.8	Congruence/ItemDiff	DEPRIORITIZED	-	-	None (answered by 5.3.9)	-	-	-	5.3.9	-	Answered by 5.3.9 paradigm-invariant NULL. Expected NULL. Logical inference: If paradigm doesn't moderate, schema unlikely to either.
5.5.1	Source-Dest/ROOT	GOLD	Quadratic (6.7%) / Log HYBRID	-	None (hybrid approach complete)	0	DONE	5.5.2,5.5.3	-	PASS	Extended 66-model complete. Quadratic vs Log ΔAIC=0.34 (TIED). HYBRID: Log for tests, 13-model averaging for plots. Extreme uncertainty (N_eff=12.32).
5.5.2	Source-Dest/Consolidation	GOLD	13-Model Averaged (ROOT-verified)	-	None (ROOT verification complete)	0	DONE	-	5.5.1	PASS	NULL 3-way ROBUST (p=0.610 Log, p=1.000 Model-Averaged). Step 06b verification: NULL interaction persists with 13-model averaged trajectories (f²=0.0000). Source and destination show identical consolidation patterns regardless of functional form. Piecewise structure (48h breakpoint, Days_within) orthogonal to trajectory model choice.
5.5.3	Source-Dest/Age	GOLD	13-Model Averaged (ROOT-verified)	-	None (ROOT verification complete)	0	DONE	-	5.5.1	PASS	NULL 3-way Age×Location×Time ROBUST (p=0.16/0.33 Log, p=1.000/1.000 Model-Averaged). Step 02b verification: Both TSVR_hours and log_TSVR interactions remain NULL with 13-model averaged trajectories. Dual time predictor robustness confirmed. Age-invariant source-destination forgetting independent of functional form. FINAL ROOT verification in Ch5.
5.5.4	Source-Dest/IRT-CTT	COMPLETE	Log	-	None	0	DONE	-	5.5.1 (none)	PASS	r_source=0.944 (EXCEPTIONAL), r_dest=0.871 (STRONG). κ=0.00 (inferential divergence). Not trajectory-dependent (measures convergence, not models).
5.5.5	Source-Dest/PurifiedCTT	COMPLETE	Log	-	None	0	DONE	-	5.5.1 (none)	PASS	Purification-Trajectory Paradox (4th replication). Destination: Δr=+0.072*** ΔAIC=+17.92 (FULL paradox). Source: Δr=+0.010 ns ΔAIC=+5.26 (PARTIAL). Not trajectory-dependent.
5.5.6	Source-Dest/Variance	COMPLETE	Log	-	None	0	DONE	-	5.5.1 (none)	PASS	OPPOSITE correlations: Source r=+0.989 (regression to mean), Dest r=-0.903 (fan effect), both p<10⁻³⁷. MAJOR novel discovery. Not trajectory-dependent.
5.5.7	Source-Dest/Clustering	COMPLETE	Log (via 5.5.6)	-	None	0	DONE	-	5.5.6,5.5.1 (none)	PASS	K=4 (BIC). EXCEPTIONAL: Silhouette=0.417 (ONLY Ch5 RQ ≥0.40 threshold), Jaccard=0.831, Davies-Bouldin=0.785. All metrics PASSED. Not trajectory-dependent.
