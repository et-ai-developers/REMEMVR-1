    RQ 5.3.5: IRT-CTT Convergence for Paradigms
    Type: Paradigms / IRT-CTT Convergence
    Analysis: Pearson r, parallel LMMs, Cohen's kappa, AIC/BIC
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.3.1 (theta + purified items + TSVR)
    Critical: Convergence thresholds r>0.70, kappa>0.60, agreement>=80%

    RQ 5.3.5: 8.9/10 CONDITIONAL. Strong theory + clear plan. 2 CRITICAL omissions: practice effects (13.3% literature), DIF/parameter drift by session.
    2 MODERATE commission errors: metric equivalence, Cohen's kappa appropriateness. 3 required changes needed for approval.

    RQ 5.3.5: 9.5/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 2.9/3 (appropriate methods). Cat2: 2.0/2 (87.5% tool reuse).
    Cat3: 1.8/2 (params specified but needs citations). Cat4: 2.0/2 (comprehensive validation procedures).
    Cat5: 0.8/1 (8 devil's advocate concerns: 1 CRITICAL convergence fragility, 5 MODERATE scale/reliability/interaction issues, 2 MINOR alternatives).
