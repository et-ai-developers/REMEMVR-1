    RQ 5.3.5: IRT-CTT Convergence for Paradigms
    Type: Paradigms / IRT-CTT Convergence
    Analysis: Pearson r, parallel LMMs, Cohen's kappa, AIC/BIC
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.3.1 (theta + purified items + TSVR)
    Critical: Convergence thresholds r>0.70, kappa>0.60, agreement>=80%

    RQ 5.3.5: RE-VALIDATED 9.4/10 APPROVED (improved from 8.9/10 CONDITIONAL). 2 CRITICAL omissions (practice effects, DIF) explicitly addressed in Section 6 with literature support (Goldberg et al. 13.3%, parameter drift). 5 Suggested Improvements recommended (optional). Ready for planning phase.

    RQ 5.3.5: 9.5/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 2.9/3 (appropriate methods). Cat2: 2.0/2 (87.5% tool reuse).
    Cat3: 1.8/2 (params specified but needs citations). Cat4: 2.0/2 (comprehensive validation procedures).
    Cat5: 0.8/1 (8 devil's advocate concerns: 1 CRITICAL convergence fragility, 5 MODERATE scale/reliability/interaction issues, 2 MINOR alternatives).

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 8 steps planned (Step 0: load dependencies from RQ 5.3.1 + Steps 1-7: analysis).
    Tool requirements: CTT computation, Pearson correlations, parallel LMM fitting (IRT vs CTT), assumption validation, Cohen's kappa agreement, AIC/BIC comparison, scatterplot/trajectory plotting.
    Expected outputs: 22 data files (correlations, LMM summaries, coefficient comparisons, agreement metrics, fit comparison, plot data). Validation required at every step.
