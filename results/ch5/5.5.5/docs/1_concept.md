# RQ 5.5.5: Source-Destination Purified CTT

**Chapter:** 5
**Type:** Source-Destination
**Subtype:** Purified CTT Effects
**Full ID:** 5.5.5

---

## Research Question

**Primary Question:**
Does IRT-based item purification improve CTT-IRT correlation for source (-U-) and destination (-D-) scores, and does the purification-trajectory paradox replicate?

**Scope:**
Tests whether removing psychometrically poor items improves correlation with IRT theta BUT worsens LMM trajectory fit (the paradox found in 5.2.5, 5.3.6, 5.4.5).

---

## Theoretical Background

The purification-trajectory paradox was discovered in RQ 5.2.5 and replicated in 5.3.6 and 5.4.5:
- Purified CTT shows HIGHER correlation with IRT theta
- BUT Purified CTT shows WORSE LMM model fit (higher AIC)

**Mechanism:** Removed items contribute noise to correlation but variance useful for trajectories.

---

## Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis:**
The purification-trajectory paradox will replicate for source-destination:
1. Purified CTT r with theta > Full CTT r with theta (p < 0.05)
2. Purified CTT AIC > Full CTT AIC (worse fit)

---

## Analysis Approach

**Design:**
- Compute Full CTT and Purified CTT for -U- and -D- separately
- Test correlation with IRT theta (Steiger's z-test)
- Compare LMM AIC for trajectory modeling
- Report reliability (Cronbach's alpha) before/after purification

**Dependencies:**
- RQ 5.5.1 MUST be complete (provides purified item list)

---

## Notes

**Matches:** RQ 5.2.5 (Domain Purified CTT), 5.3.6 (Paradigm Purified CTT), 5.4.5 (Congruence Purified CTT)
**Expected:** Paradox will replicate (4th confirmation)

**Practical Implication:** Use IRT theta or Full CTT for trajectories, Purified CTT only for cross-sectional.
