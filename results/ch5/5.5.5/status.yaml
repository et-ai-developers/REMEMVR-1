    RQ 5.5.5: Purified CTT Effects for Source-Destination
    Type: Source-Destination / Purified CTT Effects
    Analysis: CTT sum scores (Full vs Purified) + Correlation + LMM
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.5.1 (theta, purified items) + raw dfData.csv
    Critical: Tests purification-trajectory paradox (4th replication)

rq_scholar:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.3/10 APPROVED. Theory 2.9/3 (excellent psychometric paradox framework). Lit 1.8/2 (solid foundational + recent 2022-2024 cites). Guidelines 2.0/2 (perfect). Implications 2.0/2 (novel contribution). DA 0.6/1 (6 concerns: z-std limits, Tobit models, encoding quality, all MOD/MIN). Validates purification-trajectory paradox 4th replication."

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.3/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 2.8/3 (z-std AIC justification gap, bounded scale acknowledged). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 2.0/2 (all parameters specified/justified). Cat4: 1.9/2 (comprehensive validation, remedial actions vague). Cat5: 0.6/1 (8 concerns: 5 MOD, 3 MIN; z-std AIC validity, CTT variance overestimation, no effect size threshold)."

    Analysis plan created: 9 steps (Step 0: dependency validation + Steps 1-7.5: analysis + Step 8: plot prep).
    Tool requirements: CTT computation (Full/Purified), Cronbach's alpha (bootstrap), Steiger's z-test (dependent correlations), z-standardization, LMM fitting (6 parallel models), assumption validation (7 tests x 6 models).
    Expected outputs: 9 data files (item mapping, CTT scores, reliability, correlations, z-scores, AIC comparison, assumptions), 2 plot source CSVs. Validation required at every step.
