    RQ 5.11: IRT-CTT convergent validity comparison
    Domains: What/Where/When (all three domains)
    Analysis: Correlation (r > 0.90) + Parallel LMM (IRT vs CTT)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.1 IRT scores + raw data for CTT computation
    Critical: Uses purified item set from RQ 5.1 for fair comparison. Paired design (UID × Test × Domain).

rq_scholar:

    9.4/10 APPROVED. Theory exceptional (convergent validity + measurement invariance). Literature adequate (needs recent empirical citations). Interpretation perfect (r > 0.90, >80% LMM agreement thresholds). CRITICAL omission: practice effects (4-session design). 5 suggested improvements. Ready for stats validation.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.1/10 CONDITIONAL. Cat1: 2.6/3 (appropriate, minor correlation-agreement gap). Cat2: 1.9/2 (100% tools). Cat3: 1.9/2 (well-specified). Cat4: 1.9/2 (comprehensive validation). Cat5: 0.8/1 (9 concerns: 3 CRITICAL re correlation-agreement distinction + practice effects + Bland-Altman omission).
