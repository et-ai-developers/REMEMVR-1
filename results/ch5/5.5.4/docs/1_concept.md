# RQ 5.5.4: Source-Destination IRT-CTT Convergence

**Chapter:** 5
**Type:** Source-Destination
**Subtype:** IRT-CTT Convergence
**Full ID:** 5.5.4

---

## Research Question

**Primary Question:**
Do IRT theta and CTT sum scores show high convergence for source (-U-) and destination (-D-) memory, validating RQ 5.5.1 findings are not measurement artifacts?

**Scope:**
Tests static correlation (r > 0.70), dynamic agreement (kappa > 0.60), and structural equivalence between IRT and CTT scoring approaches.

---

## Theoretical Background

The IRT-CTT convergence trilogy (5.2.4, 5.3.5, 5.4.4) established that findings across Chapter 5 are robust to measurement approach. This RQ extends validation to the source-destination factor.

**Thresholds (from convergence trilogy):**
- Static r > 0.70
- Cohen's kappa > 0.60
- Agreement > 80%

---

## Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis:**
IRT and CTT will converge strongly (r > 0.70) for both -U- and -D- scores, validating RQ 5.5.1 findings.

---

## Analysis Approach

**Design:**
- Compute IRT theta and CTT sum for -U- and -D- separately
- Test correlations, Cohen's kappa for LMM fixed effects
- Compare trajectory patterns

**Dependencies:**
- RQ 5.5.1 MUST be complete (provides IRT calibration and findings to validate)

---

## Notes

**Matches:** RQ 5.2.4 (Domain IRT-CTT), 5.3.5 (Paradigm IRT-CTT), 5.4.4 (Congruence IRT-CTT)
**Expected:** High convergence (consistent with Chapter 5 pattern)
