    RQ 5.10: Domain-specific age effects on forgetting
    Domains: What/Where/When (all three)
    Analysis: LMM with 3-way Age × Domain × Time interaction
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.1 theta scores + Age from dfData.csv
    Critical: Treatment coding (What reference), Bonferroni α=0.0033, age tertiles for viz only

    9.3/10 APPROVED. Theory strong (hippocampal aging, dual-process), lit adequate (needs 2020-2024 citations). 5 optional improvements: add Cheke 2022 (temporal vulnerability), Zheng 2020 (subfield aging), acknowledge perirhinal aging, justify immersive VR design. Ready for stats.

  context_dump: "9.7/10 APPROVED. Category 1: 2.8/3 (appropriate, sample size marginal for 3-way interaction). Category 2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Category 3: 2.0/2 (comprehensive). Category 4: 2.0/2 (thorough validation). Category 5: 0.9/1 (9 concerns, 5 MODERATE, 4 MINOR)."

    6 steps planned (Step 0: get data from RQ 5.1 + Steps 1-5: LMM analysis)
    Analysis: LMM-only with 3-way Age x Domain x Time interaction
    Dependencies: RQ 5.1 (theta scores, TSVR mapping), dfData.csv (age)
    Key methods: Grand-mean centering Age, TSVR time variable (D070), Bonferroni correction (D068), assumption validation, random effects model selection
    Outputs: LMM model, 3-way interaction terms, domain-specific age effects, post-hoc contrasts, age effects plot data
