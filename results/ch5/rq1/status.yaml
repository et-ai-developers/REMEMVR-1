    Created results/ch5/rq1/ with 6 folders
    Folders: docs/, data/, code/, logs/, plots/, results/
    All folders empty, ready for agents
    status.yaml initialized with 10 RQ-specific agents
    Next: rq_concept extracts concept from thesis

    RQ 5.1: Domain-specific forgetting trajectories (What/Where/When)
    Domains: What (-N-), Where (-L-/-U-/-D-), When (-O-)
    Analysis: IRT (2-pass GRM purification) + LMM (5 candidate models, AIC selection)
    Data: RAW from master.xlsx via dfData.csv, TQ_* items dichotomized
    Critical: TSVR time variable (actual hours), dual-scale reporting (theta + probability)

    9.1/10 CONDITIONAL - Strong theory, needs recent cites + practice effects ack, ready for stats

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "8.2/10 REJECTED. Cat1: 2.4/3 (appropriate, N=100 marginal for slopes). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 1.6/2 (params specified, validation incomplete). Cat4: 1.3/2 (purification good, Q3/LMM diagnostics missing). Cat5: 0.9/1 (9 concerns, 4 CRITICAL). Must add: Q3 validation, convergence strategy, LMM diagnostics, practice effects."

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    8 analysis steps planned (Step 0: extraction + Steps 1-7: analysis)
    Pipeline: IRT (2-pass purification: Pass1->Purify->Pass2) + LMM (5 candidate models) + post-hoc contrasts
    Tools needed: IRT calibration (GRM 3 factors), purification (D039), LMM with TSVR (D070), post-hoc (D068), plot data prep (D069 dual-scale)
    Outputs: theta scores, LMM model summary, contrasts, effect sizes, 2 plot source CSVs (theta + probability scales)
    Validation: 100% coverage (all 8 steps have 4-layer substance criteria for rq_inspect)
