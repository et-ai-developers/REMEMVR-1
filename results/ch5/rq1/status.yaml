    RQ 5.1: Domain-Specific Forgetting Trajectories (What/Where/When)
    Domains: What (-N-), Where (-L-/-U-/-D-), When (-O-)
    Analysis: IRT (2-pass GRM purification) + LMM (5 trajectory models, Domain x Time interaction)
    Data: RAW from dfData.csv (TQ_* columns), dichotomized accuracy, TSVR time variable
    Critical: 2-pass purification (|b|>3 or a<0.4 removed), dual-scale reporting (theta + probability)

rq_scholar:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.3/10 APPROVED. Theory excellent (2.8/3), literature good (1.7/2 - add 3-5 recent cites), interpretation perfect (2.0/2), implications strong (1.9/2). 4 omission errors (practice effects, encoding quality), 2 alternative frameworks (schema theory, cue quality). Ready for stats.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.4/10 APPROVED. Category 1: 3.0/3 (optimal methods). Category 2: 2.0/2 (100% tool reuse). Category 3: 1.8/2 (parameters clear, missing citations). Category 4: 1.8/2 (implicit validation via purification/AIC). Category 5: 0.8/1 (4 concerns, literature-cited, below 5-concern target).

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    8 analysis steps planned (Step 0: extraction + Steps 1-7: analysis/viz)
    Pipeline: IRT (2-pass purification) -> LMM (5 models) -> post-hoc contrasts -> dual-scale plots
    Tools needed: IRT calibration (GRM, 3 dimensions), purification (D039), LMM trajectory (TSVR D070), contrasts (D068), plot data prep (D069)
    Outputs: theta_scores (3 dims), item_params (purified), LMM summary (best model), contrasts (dual p-values), plot CSVs (theta + probability)
    Validation: 100% coverage (all 8 steps have embedded validation requirements)

rq_tools:
  status: failed
  completed: 2025-11-21 23:59
  context_dump: |
    FAILED: Incomplete tool documentation in tools_inventory.md
    Missing: filter_items_by_quality (exists in code but not documented with signature)
    Ambiguous: Step 0 data extraction, Step 7 plot data prep (no specific tools named in 2_plan.md)
    Required: Add filter_items_by_quality to tools_inventory.md Module:tools.analysis_irt section
    TDD Detection: Documentation gap triggers user+master review -> update docs -> re-run
