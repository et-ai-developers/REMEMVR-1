    RQ 5.5.6: Source-Destination Variance Decomposition
    Type: Source-Destination / Variance Decomposition
    Analysis: LMM variance decomposition (location-stratified)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.5.1 (theta + LMM fitted model)
    Critical: ICC_slope ~0 expected, 200 random effects for RQ 5.5.7

rq_scholar:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.4/10 APPROVED. Theory excellent (source-destination variance decomposition, ICC grounding), literature strong (7 citations: Cicchetti, Barr, Oberpriller, individual differences). 6 suggested improvements (practice effects, singular fits, VR dropout). Ready for stats validation."

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.6/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 3.0/3 (appropriate). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 1.8/2 (well-specified, minor ICC threshold gap). Cat4: 2.0/2 (comprehensive). Cat5: 0.8/1 (5 concerns, good quality, could be more exhaustive)."

    6 steps planned: LMM variance decomposition (location-stratified)
    Tools: fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr, extract variance, compute ICC, test correlations (D068)
    Outputs: 10 variance components, 6 ICC estimates, 200 random effects (CRITICAL for RQ 5.5.7)
    Dependency: RQ 5.5.1 complete required
    Validation: Embedded per-step (LMM convergence, variance positivity, ICC bounds, dual p-values)
