    RQ 5.3.9: Paradigm × Item Difficulty Interaction
    Type: Paradigms / Tests difficulty × time interaction across Free/Cued/Recognition
    Analysis: Cross-classified LMM with (Time | UID) + (1 | Item) random effects
    Data: DERIVED item difficulty from RQ 5.3.1 + RAW responses from dfData.csv
    Critical: 3-way interaction Time × Difficulty_c × paradigm, Bonferroni alpha=0.0033

    RQ 5.3.9 validated: 9.3/10.0 APPROVED. Dual-process & retrieval-support theory solid. 4 suggested improvements (paradigm-invariance, practice effects, context-dependency, ceiling effects). Ready for analysis planning.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.8/10 APPROVED. Category 1: 3.0/3 (crossed LMM appropriate). Category 2: 2.0/2 (100% tool reuse). Category 3: 2.0/2 (well-specified). Category 4: 2.0/2 (comprehensive validation). Category 5: 0.8/1 (11 concerns: commission/omission/alternatives/pitfalls). Strengths: methodology excellent, convergence checks solid, dual p-value reporting. Address 3 CRITICAL improvements: convergence fallback decision tree, power analysis for 3-way interaction, multiple testing control for follow-up slopes.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 5 steps planned (Step 0: extraction + Steps 1-4: analysis).
    Tool requirements: Cross-classified LMM with crossed random effects (Time | UID) + (1 | Item), 3-way interaction testing (Time x Difficulty_c x paradigm).
    Expected outputs: 8 data files (response-level data, lmm_input, model summaries, interaction results, plot source CSV). Validation required at every step.
    Cross-RQ dependency: RQ 5.3.1 item parameters + TSVR mapping. Convergence strategy documented (simplify random structure if needed per rq_stats feedback).

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Tool catalog created: 1 analysis + 7 validation tools for cross-classified LMM analysis.
    Analysis tools: fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr (3-way interaction with crossed random effects).
    Validation: 7 tools (data format, missing data, standardization, LMM convergence, assumptions, hypothesis test D068, plot completeness).
    Stdlib exempt: pandas operations (extraction/merge/centering) not cataloged.
    Decisions: D068 dual p-values, D070 TSVR time variable, convergence strategy documented.

rq_analysis:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    5 steps specified with validation (cross-classified LMM)
    Step 0-2: stdlib (extraction/composite_ID/centering)
    Step 3: fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr (catalogued tool)
    Step 4: stdlib (interaction extraction/plot prep)
    All steps have multiple validation tools (D068 dual p-values)

  step00_extract_response_data: success

rq_inspect:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Validated all 5 analysis steps (step00-step04) - ALL PASS
    Data: 18,000 observations (100 UIDs x 4 tests x 45 purified items)
    Key finding: 3-way interaction NOT significant (p_bonf > 0.0033)
    Model converged, dual p-values present (D068 compliant)
    Assumption warnings documented (exploratory analysis tolerates)
