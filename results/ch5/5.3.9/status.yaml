    RQ 5.3.9: Paradigm × Item Difficulty Interaction
    Type: Paradigms / Tests difficulty × time interaction across Free/Cued/Recognition
    Analysis: Cross-classified LMM with (Time | UID) + (1 | Item) random effects
    Data: DERIVED item difficulty from RQ 5.3.1 + RAW responses from dfData.csv
    Critical: 3-way interaction Time × Difficulty_c × paradigm, Bonferroni alpha=0.0033

    RQ 5.3.9 validated: 9.3/10.0 APPROVED. Dual-process & retrieval-support theory solid. 4 suggested improvements (paradigm-invariance, practice effects, context-dependency, ceiling effects). Ready for analysis planning.

  context_dump: |
    9.8/10 APPROVED. Category 1: 3.0/3 (crossed LMM appropriate). Category 2: 2.0/2 (100% tool reuse). Category 3: 2.0/2 (well-specified). Category 4: 2.0/2 (comprehensive validation). Category 5: 0.8/1 (11 concerns: commission/omission/alternatives/pitfalls). Strengths: methodology excellent, convergence checks solid, dual p-value reporting. Address 3 CRITICAL improvements: convergence fallback decision tree, power analysis for 3-way interaction, multiple testing control for follow-up slopes.
