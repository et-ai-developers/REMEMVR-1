### Detailed Rubric Evaluation

#### Category 1: Theoretical Grounding (2.9 / 3.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Alignment with episodic memory theory (established framework)
- [x] Domain-specific theoretical rationale (paradigm-dependent effects)
- [x] Theoretical coherence (all claims internally consistent)

**Assessment:**

The RQ demonstrates strong theoretical grounding in dual-process memory theory (Yonelinas, 2002) and retrieval support hypothesis. The hypothesis correctly characterizes:

1. **Dual-process framework:** Recognition memory depends on both familiarity and recollection, with familiarity being more item-dependent and automatic, while recollection is effortful and context-dependent.

2. **Retrieval support continuum:** Free Recall (minimal support) vs. Cued Recall (moderate support) vs. Recognition (maximal support) represents a well-established theoretical distinction in memory research. This is grounded in encoding specificity principle (Tulving & Thomson, 1973) and widely replicated in the literature.

3. **Item difficulty interactions:** The prediction that item difficulty effects might differ by paradigm is theoretically coherent - if paradigms rely on different cognitive processes (familiarity vs. recollection), they could interact differently with item characteristics.

The theoretical rationale at lines 36-38 correctly articulates the key distinction: "If item difficulty effects reflect encoding strength, all paradigms should show similar difficulty × time interactions. However, if difficulty effects reflect retrieval process characteristics, paradigms may differ."

**Strengths:**
- Grounding in established dual-process theory with appropriate citations
- Clear articulation of theoretical predictions and their contingencies
- Recognition of competing hypotheses (ceiling effects vs. faster forgetting)
- Appropriate use of cross-classified design (UID × Item random effects) reflecting theoretical complexity

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Citation to Yonelinas (2002) is foundational but predates recent dual-process refinements (2020-2024). Recent research suggests recollection sometimes dominates familiarity in recognition judgments (opposite of classic dual-process prediction).

**Score Justification:**

Score of 2.9/3.0 reflects strong theoretical grounding with minor gap in acknowledging recent refinements to dual-process theory. The core theoretical framework is solid and appropriate for this RQ, but recent 2020-2024 literature showing nuances in how recollection and familiarity interact in recognition memory could strengthen the theoretical backdrop.

---

#### Category 2: Literature Support (1.7 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Recent citations present (2020-2024)
- [x] Seminal works included (foundational references)
- [ ] Complete coverage of all major claims

**Assessment:**

The RQ cites Yonelinas (2002) as the primary theoretical source, which is appropriate and seminal for dual-process theory. However, the literature support has gaps:

**Present:**
- Yonelinas (2002) on dual-process recognition: High relevance foundation
- Implicit reference to retrieval support hypothesis: Standard cognitive psychology principle

**Missing or Incomplete:**
- No recent (2020-2024) citations on how dual-process predictions hold in longitudinal VR memory research
- Recent literature on item difficulty effects in recognition memory with modern neuroimaging is absent
- No citations on retrieval-induced forgetting or how testing paradigms interact with item characteristics in repeated-measures designs
- Virtual reality memory literature not cited despite experimental design using VR

**WebSearch Findings:**

Recent research (2020-2024) reveals:
1. Dual-process theory continues to be supported, but recent work shows recollection can dominate familiarity in recognition tasks (contradicting simpler predictions)
2. VR memory research demonstrates context-dependent effects and potential confounds from repeated testing
3. Item difficulty effects on forgetting are documented, but paradigm-specific interactions are underexplored in the literature
4. Practice effects and ceiling effects are known confounds in repeated VR memory testing

**Score Justification:**

Score of 1.7/2.0 reflects adequate foundational literature with noted gaps in recent citations (2020-2024) and missing VR-specific references. The RQ's statement "[To be added by rq_scholar]" at line 34 and "[To be identified by rq_scholar - specifically regarding paradigm-dependent item difficulty effects...]" at line 41 confirms concept.md anticipated additional literature review.

#### Category 3: Interpretation Guidelines (2.0 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Comprehensive scenario coverage (all expected result patterns addressed)
- [x] Theoretical connection (results linked back to theory)
- [x] Practical clarity (actionable guidance for results-inspector)

**Assessment:**

The RQ provides excellent interpretation guidance across multiple result scenarios:

**Scenario 1: 3-way interaction significant (line 57-58):**
- Expectation: Paradigm-stratified difficulty × time slopes extracted and compared
- Theoretical interpretation: Evidence that retrieval support level moderates item difficulty effects on forgetting
- Action: Plot shows 6 trajectories; follow-up examines magnitude differences across paradigms
- Clarity: Very clear guidance for paradigm-stratified interpretation

**Scenario 2: 3-way interaction null (line 37-38):**
- Expectation: Difficulty affects intercept uniformly across paradigms
- Theoretical interpretation: Item difficulty effects on memory are not fundamentally altered by retrieval paradigm
- Guidance: Interpretation shifts to domain-general encoding strength effects
- Clarity: Clearly articulated alternative explanation

**Scenario 3: Unexpected patterns (lines 36-38):**
- Concept.md acknowledges competing predictions (ceiling effects vs. faster forgetting)
- Guidance provided for distinguishing between: (1) positive interaction (weaker encoding), (2) negative interaction (ceiling effects), (3) no interaction (uniform effects)

**Strengths:**
- All three major result patterns explicitly addressed
- Recognition of competing theoretical explanations (ceiling effect alternative)
- Clear link between results and theoretical mechanisms (encoding strength vs. retrieval process)
- Plot interpretation guidance provided (line 114: "Trajectories show clear divergence [if significant] or parallelism [if non-significant]")
- Success criteria at lines 126-135 provide concrete validation checkpoints

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Could explicitly address what it would mean if difficulty × time interactions REVERSED direction between paradigms (e.g., easier items decay faster in Recognition but slower in Free Recall)
- No guidance on interpreting paradigm-specific slopes with different magnitudes vs. opposite directions

**Score Justification:**

Score of 2.0/2.0 reflects comprehensive interpretation guidance for all major result scenarios with clear theoretical grounding and practical clarity. Minor enhancements possible (reverse-direction interactions, slope magnitude interpretation) but not required for gold standard approval.

---

#### Category 4: Theoretical Implications (2.0 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Clear contribution to episodic memory theory (novel or incremental)
- [x] Specific and falsifiable implications (stated clearly)
- [x] Broader impact (VR memory assessment, clinical applications)

**Assessment:**

The RQ articulates clear theoretical contributions and implications:

**Primary Contribution (lines 12-13, 18-19):**
- Tests whether item difficulty effects on forgetting vary by retrieval support level
- If significant: Evidence that retrieval paradigm fundamentally alters how item difficulty influences memory decay
- If null: Evidence that item difficulty effects are paradigm-independent (encoding-strength driven)
- Either outcome advances understanding of memory consolidation and retrieval processes

**Theoretical Specificity (lines 48-54):**
- Hypothesis clearly predicts 3-way interaction would be significant IF difficulty effects reflect retrieval process characteristics
- Alternative (null interaction) clearly stated IF difficulty effects reflect encoding strength
- Both outcomes are falsifiable and have specific theoretical interpretations

**Broader Impact:**
- **VR Memory Assessment (implicit):** Results inform whether VR-based memory tests need paradigm-adjusted difficulty calibrations
- **Clinical Applications (implicit):** Understanding item difficulty × paradigm interactions could improve memory assessment tools for neurological populations
- **Theoretical significance:** Advances understanding of how episodic memory consolidation is modulated by retrieval support

**Strengths:**
- Clear articulation of what each outcome would mean theoretically
- Falsifiable predictions (3-way interaction vs. null tested at Bonferroni alpha = 0.0033)
- Recognition that results disambiguate between encoding-strength vs. retrieval-process explanations
- Implications for interpretation in RQ Section 5 (Interpretation Guidelines)

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Could be more explicit about clinical/applied implications for memory assessment
- Discussion of what findings would contribute to "dual-process theory refinement" versus "general memory theory"

**Score Justification:**

Score of 2.0/2.0 reflects clear theoretical contributions and appropriate level of specificity. Implications are well-articulated and falsifiable. While clinical applications are implicit rather than explicit, this is appropriate for a foundational RQ testing paradigm-dependent memory effects.

#### Category 5: Devil's Advocate Analysis (0.7 / 1.0)

**Purpose:** Evaluate quality of agent-generated scholarly criticisms and literature-grounded rebuttals.

**Criteria Assessment:**

Two-pass WebSearch conducted:
- **Pass 1 (Validation):** 3 queries confirming dual-process theory, retrieval paradigm effects, item difficulty interactions
- **Pass 2 (Challenge):** 3 queries searching for practice effects, ceiling effects, encoding quality confounds, methodological limitations

**Criticisms Identified (Evidence-Based via WebSearch):**

#### Commission Errors (Critiques of Claims Made)

**1. Recent Dual-Process Theory Refinements Not Acknowledged**
- **Location:** Section 2: Theoretical Background - line 27
- **Claim Made:** "Familiarity processes may show stronger item difficulty effects than recollection-based retrieval" (assumes familiarity is more item-dependent)
- **Scholarly Criticism:** Recent dual-process research (2020-2024) shows recollection can dominate familiarity in recognition decisions, contrary to simpler dual-process predictions. The assumption that familiarity is uniformly more item-dependent needs qualification.
- **Counterevidence:** PMC7301754 research found "recollection dominated familiarity such that familiarity ratings were only predictive of confidence when recollection ratings were relatively weaker."
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "Acknowledge that while classic dual-process theory predicts familiarity-driven recognition shows stronger item difficulty effects, recent research shows recollection can dominate recognition judgments. This RQ tests whether such dominance patterns vary by item difficulty and paradigm type."

#### Omission Errors (Missing Context or Claims)

**1. No Acknowledgment of Practice Effects Confounding Forgetting Trajectories**
- **Missing Content:** 1_concept.md does not address that participants complete the same 3 paradigms (IFR, ICR, IRE) across 4 test sessions. Practice effects from repeated testing could confound item difficulty × time interactions.
- **Why It Matters:** Practice effects could mask or enhance difficulty × time interactions differentially by paradigm. If Recognition paradigm benefits more from practice effects than Free Recall, difficulty effects might appear artificially stronger in Recognition due to improved performance on difficult items through practice, not reduced familiarity effects.
- **Supporting Literature:** Nature (2024) study on "A working memory dependent dual process model of the testing effect" found testing effects depend on working memory capacity and item familiarity - practice effects interact with item characteristics.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "How do you distinguish genuine paradigm-dependent difficulty × time interactions from artifacts caused by differential practice effects across retrieval paradigms?"
- **Strength:** CRITICAL
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 4: Analysis Strategy - acknowledge repeated-measures design allows practice effects, discuss whether (Time | UID) random slopes account for practice via learning curves, or propose including Test Session as covariate/control variable in LMM. IRT theta scoring approach helps separate item difficulty from participant ability, potentially mitigating practice-effect confounds."

**2. No Discussion of Ceiling/Floor Effects from Item Difficulty Stratification**
- **Missing Content:** Concept.md predicts easier vs. harder items will show different forgetting trajectories but does not address whether ceiling effects on easy items could create artificial negative interactions (easier items appear more resilient due to floor effects on recognition performance).
- **Why It Matters:** If easy items induce ceiling-effect performance in recognition conditions, observed flat trajectories could reflect measurement limitation rather than encoding strength differences.
- **Supporting Literature:** 2024 Frontiers study found "ceiling effects limiting detection of group differences" when retention intervals are short. REMEMVR's 6-day span may not be sufficient to detect forgetting for easy items in recognition paradigm.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Did you examine whether ceiling/floor effects vary by paradigm and difficulty level, and could these measurement artifacts explain the hypothesized difficulty × paradigm interactions?"
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 7: Limitations - acknowledge that easy items may induce ceiling effects, particularly in Recognition paradigm. Discuss whether non-parametric or ordinal analyses needed if ceiling effects present. Alternatively, add raw accuracy distributions by item difficulty and paradigm to results/step03_difficulty_paradigm_interaction.csv for transparency."

**3. No Mention of Context-Dependency Effects from VR Multi-Session Design**
- **Missing Content:** Participants encode 4 rooms (one per session) and test each room 4 times (across days 0, 1, 3, 6). Concept.md does not address whether context (which room, which session) could interact with paradigm and item difficulty effects. VR literature highlights context-dependent memory as a major factor.
- **Why It Matters:** If room context becomes a confound, difficulty × paradigm × time effects could be masked or inflated by room-level variation. For example, a difficult item in one room might decay differently due to room-context distinctiveness, not item difficulty or paradigm.
- **Supporting Literature:** Frontiers (2021) study "Changing Between Virtual Reality and Real-World Adversely Affects Memory Recall Accuracy" found context changes impair recall (17% accuracy decrease). REMEMVR's multi-room design could introduce context-dependency confounds.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Did you include room (or context) as a random effect to account for context-dependent memory effects? Could difficulty × paradigm interactions reflect room-specific effects rather than paradigm-dependent item difficulty effects?"
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 4: Analysis Strategy - justify random effects structure. Consider whether (1 | Item) random intercept is sufficient, or whether (1 | Room) and crossed structure (UID | Item, Room) would better capture context-dependent effects. Discuss whether item nested within room (1 | Room/Item) is conceptually appropriate."

**4. No Justification for Why IRT Difficulty Estimates from RQ 5.3.1 Remain Valid for Paradigm-Stratified Analysis**
- **Missing Content:** RQ 5.3.1 provides item difficulty estimates derived from IRT calibration. These difficulty estimates may have been calibrated on the full omnibus sample (IFR + ICR + IRE combined). Using omnibus difficulty estimates to stratify analyses by paradigm assumes item difficulty is paradigm-invariant - but this may not hold if items are easier/harder depending on retrieval support level.
- **Why It Matters:** If item difficulty is paradigm-dependent (an item might be "easy" in recognition but "hard" in free recall), using omnibus IRT difficulty estimates to stratify paradigm-specific analyses introduces a circularity: you're testing whether paradigms differ in how they use item difficulty, but using paradigm-averaged difficulty values.
- **Supporting Literature:** Retrieval support hypothesis predicts items should not have uniform difficulty across paradigms - recognition provides maximum support and should reduce difficulty variation.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Did you examine whether item difficulty estimates differ by paradigm (e.g., IFR vs. IRE)? If not, why is omnibus difficulty appropriate for paradigm-stratified analysis?"
- **Strength:** CRITICAL
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 3: Data Source or Section 4: Analysis Approach - clarify whether item difficulty estimates from RQ 5.3.1 are (a) paradigm-specific or (b) omnibus. If omnibus, discuss whether paradigm-invariant difficulty assumption is justified given retrieval support hypothesis. Alternatively, conduct preliminary paradigm-specific IRT calibrations to test whether difficulty estimates differ by paradigm before proceeding with main analysis."

#### Alternative Theoretical Frameworks (Not Considered)

**1. Encoding Recency vs. Encoding Strength as Competing Explanations**
- **Alternative Theory:** Differences in forgetting rates might not reflect item difficulty (encoding strength) at all, but rather encoding recency. Easier items might be rehearsed more during encoding (more recent encoding), leading to less forgetting. This "encoding recency" explanation competes with "item difficulty reflects encoding strength."
- **How It Applies:** If participants naturally rehearse easy items more during the 10-minute encoding phase (because they're easy to remember and thus get re-attended), observed forgetting trajectories would reflect rehearsal recency rather than initial encoding strength.
- **Key Citation:** 2024 Hierarchical Event Segmentation study suggests event boundaries and rehearsal patterns fundamentally structure episodic memory - encoding recency effects may compete with item-difficulty effects.
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** Reviewers might ask whether slower forgetting of difficult items (if observed) reflects true encoding strength differences or selection bias in rehearsal patterns during initial encoding.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** "Add to Section 2: Theoretical Background - briefly acknowledge that initial difficulty differences could reflect encoding quality OR rehearsal patterns during encoding. Justify why longitudinal slope differences (not intercepts) focus on forgetting rate independent of initial encoding recency. Discuss whether participants were given equal time per item or allowed free-choice exploration (which could introduce rehearsal recency bias)."

**2. Strength-Based Consolidation vs. Support-Based Retrieval Differences**
- **Alternative Theory:** Observed difficulty × paradigm interactions might not reflect retrieval paradigm differences at all, but rather differences in how item strength consolidates over time. Maybe easier items consolidate faster (stronger memory trace), leading to less forgetting, regardless of how they're retrieved. This explanation would be paradigm-independent and contradict the RQ's main prediction.
- **How It Applies:** If consolidation speed is driven by initial item strength rather than paradigm differences, the 3-way interaction would be null even though difficulty × time interactions exist within each paradigm. Paradigm would not moderate the effect.
- **Key Citation:** Hierarchy event segmentation research and consolidation literature suggest strength-driven consolidation may be a general mechanism, not paradigm-specific.
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** Null 3-way interaction results could reflect strength-based consolidation (paradigm-independent) rather than absence of paradigm effects. The RQ should discuss this explicitly in interpretation guidance.
- **Strength:** MINOR (already implicitly addressed by inclusion of "no interaction" scenario, but could be more explicit)
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** Interpretation guidance already includes this scenario (line 37-38: "no interaction [difficulty affects intercept only, uniform across paradigms]"). Could explicitly frame this as "strength-based consolidation hypothesis" vs. "retrieval-process hypothesis" for clarity.

#### Known Methodological Confounds (Unaddressed)

**1. Ceiling/Floor Effects Masking Paradigm-Specific Interactions**
- **Confound Description:** Recognition paradigm provides maximum support, often resulting in ceiling-effect performance (85-95% correct). If easy items in recognition hit ceiling by Day 0, they cannot show further improvement or degradation, limiting variance available for detecting interactions.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** Ceiling effects would artificially reduce difficulty × time interactions in recognition paradigm (cannot show decay if already at ceiling), potentially masking true paradigm differences.
- **Literature Evidence:** 2024 Frontiers VR study documented ceiling effects limiting detection of group differences in memory tasks with short retention intervals.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** REMEMVR's 6-day span may be insufficient to avoid ceiling effects in recognition paradigm, particularly for easy items.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 7: Limitations - acknowledge potential ceiling effects in recognition paradigm for easy items. Consider whether (a) analyses should exclude ceiling-bound items, (b) ordinal/non-parametric approaches used, or (c) arcsine-transformation applied to bounded accuracy scores. Report proportion of participants hitting ceiling by paradigm and item difficulty in results/step03_difficulty_paradigm_interaction.csv."

**2. Confidence Ratings Influencing Item Selection vs. True Memory Decay**
- **Confound Description:** REMEMVR includes confidence ratings for each item. If participants downrate confidence on easy items over time (perceived difficulty increases as items become harder to remember), observed "forgetting" might reflect confidence recalibration rather than true memory decay.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** Item difficulty derived from IRT pass 0 (based on endorsement probability) might shift if participants use confidence-dependent responding strategies across test sessions.
- **Literature Evidence:** Methods.md mentions "Confidence ratings were rescaled to a continuous 0–1 metric" and "Likert response biases...were identified and corrected" - suggesting confidence response patterns may be variable across sessions.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** If confidence response biases vary by paradigm (e.g., more conservative in free recall), this could confound difficulty × paradigm interactions.
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 7: Limitations - acknowledge that confidence rescaling and bias correction were performed. Discuss whether confidence-response patterns varied by paradigm and whether any paradigm × time interactions in confidence patterns could confound item-memory interactions. Consider including confidence rating (or confidence × item response interaction) as covariate in LMM sensitivity analysis."

**3. Item Purification in RQ 5.3.1 May Be Paradigm-Specific**
- **Confound Description:** RQ 5.3.1 purified items based on IRT criteria (a >= 0.4, |b| <= 3.0, line 174). If purification removed different proportions of items from different paradigms (e.g., removed more difficult free-recall items), the retained item set might have paradigm-specific sampling bias.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** Observed difficulty × paradigm interactions could reflect differential item purification rather than true paradigm differences in how items decay.
- **Literature Evidence:** IRT purification literature shows difficulty parameters are scale-dependent; paradigm-specific scales might have different purification effects.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** Step 1 (line 99) loads item parameters from RQ 5.3.1. If those parameters reflect paradigm-biased purification, downstream difficulties × paradigm analysis inherits that bias.
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 3: Data Source - clarify whether RQ 5.3.1 purification was performed on omnibus item sample (IFR + ICR + IRE combined) or paradigm-specific samples. If omnibus, report proportion of items retained per paradigm post-purification to assess differential item loss. Consider whether paradigm-specific purification would be more theoretically justified."

#### Scoring Summary

**Total Concerns Identified:**
- Commission Errors: 1 (0 CRITICAL, 1 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)
- Omission Errors: 4 (2 CRITICAL, 2 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)
- Alternative Frameworks: 2 (0 CRITICAL, 1 MODERATE, 1 MINOR)
- Methodological Confounds: 3 (0 CRITICAL, 2 MODERATE, 1 MINOR)

**Overall Devil's Advocate Assessment:**

The concept.md demonstrates solid theoretical grounding but exhibits several important omissions around practice effects, context-dependency, ceiling effects, and validity of paradigm-invariant item difficulty estimates. The most critical concerns are:

1. **Practice Effects Confound (CRITICAL):** The RQ does not address how repeated testing across 4 sessions could interact with paradigm and item difficulty. Given that IRT theta approach should account for this, explicit acknowledgment and discussion of mitigation would strengthen the concept.

2. **Paradigm-Invariant Difficulty Assumption (CRITICAL):** Using omnibus IRT difficulty estimates (potentially from combined paradigms) to stratify paradigm-specific analyses introduces a conceptual issue. If item difficulty varies by retrieval support, this assumption is violated.

Both critical issues are addressable and do not fundamentally invalidate the RQ design, but require explicit discussion in concept.md. The CRITICAL strength rating reflects that reviewers will likely raise these concerns and expect responses.

Moderate-strength concerns (ceiling effects, context-dependency, confidence biases) are real and should be discussed in Section 7: Limitations. The agent's devil's advocate analysis is comprehensive and literature-grounded, providing actionable recommendations for strengthening the concept document.

**Score Justification:**

Score of 0.7/1.0 reflects good coverage of substantive criticisms with literature grounding (6 identified concerns via WebSearch), but with some limitations:
- Missing discussion of how RQ 5.3.1's item purification bias might affect downstream analysis (paradigm-specific sampling)
- Could identify additional alternatives (e.g., spacing effects, retrieval-induced forgetting in paradigm-stratified contexts)
- Rebuttal quality is strong but could include more specific statistical approaches to address concerns

### Scholarly Criticisms & Rebuttals

**Analysis Approach:**
- **Two-Pass WebSearch Strategy:**
  1. **Validation Pass:** Verified that dual-process theory, retrieval support hypothesis, and item difficulty effects are established in literature
  2. **Challenge Pass:** Searched for counterevidence, alternative theories, practice effects, ceiling effects, context-dependency, and paradigm-specific assumptions
- **Focus:** Commission errors (claims that may need refinement), omission errors (important context missing), alternative frameworks (competing explanations), methodological confounds (design threats to validity)
- **Grounding:** All criticisms cite specific literature sources from WebSearch results

---

#### Commission Errors (Critiques of Claims Made)

**1. Recent Dual-Process Refinements Not Acknowledged**
- **Location:** Section 2: Theoretical Background - line 27
- **Claim Made:** "Recognition memory can rely on both familiarity (fast, automatic, item-dependent) and recollection (slow, effortful)" with implied prediction that familiarity drives item-specific effects
- **Scholarly Criticism:** Recent dual-process research (2020-2024) shows recollection can dominate familiarity in recognition judgments, contrary to the assumption that familiarity is uniformly more item-dependent than recollection in recognition contexts
- **Counterevidence:** PMC7301754 research found "recollection dominated familiarity such that familiarity ratings were only predictive of confidence when recollection ratings were relatively weaker. When recollection ratings were stronger, familiarity made no contribution to recognition confidence."
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** "Revise Section 2 to note that while classic dual-process theory predicts familiarity-driven recognition should show stronger item-specific effects, recent research shows recollection can dominate even in recognition tasks. This RQ tests whether item difficulty effects vary by paradigm, which would provide evidence about whether recollection dominance varies with item characteristics (e.g., difficult items rely more on recollection, easy items on familiarity)."

---

#### Omission Errors (Missing Context or Claims)

**1. No Acknowledgment of Practice Effects Confounding Forgetting Trajectories**
- **Missing Content:** RQ 5.3.9 involves testing the same three paradigms (IFR, ICR, IRE) across 4 sessions (Days 0, 1, 3, 6). Participants will become increasingly familiar with the task structure across sessions. Concept.md does not address whether practice effects could confound item difficulty × time interactions, particularly if different paradigms are susceptible to different levels of practice effects.
- **Why It Matters:** Practice effects could inflate or suppress observed difficulty × paradigm interactions. For example, if recognition paradigm benefits more from practice effects (easier task structure to learn) than free recall, difficulty effects might appear artificially amplified in recognition due to improved overall performance through task familiarity rather than reduced familiarity effects. The IRT theta-scoring approach should account for overall ability growth, but explicit discussion would strengthen confidence in this mitigation.
- **Supporting Literature:** Nature (2024) "A working memory dependent dual process model of the testing effect" found testing effects depend on working memory capacity and item characteristics - practice effects interact with item difficulty, suggesting paradigm-specific confound is plausible
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "How do you distinguish genuine paradigm-dependent difficulty × time interactions from artifacts caused by differential learning curves across retrieval paradigms?"
- **Strength:** CRITICAL
- **Suggested Addition:** "Expand Section 4: Analysis Approach with discussion of practice effects. Explicitly state whether (Time | UID) random slopes for participant-specific time trends account for practice effects, or whether Test Session should be included as additional covariate. Discuss whether IRT theta-scoring approach (which separates participant ability growth from item difficulty estimates) adequately mitigates practice-effect confounds. Justify why main analysis focuses on within-paradigm difficulty × time slopes rather than between-paradigm comparisons of slope magnitudes if practice effects differ by paradigm."

**2. No Discussion of Ceiling/Floor Effects from Item Difficulty Stratification**
- **Missing Content:** RQ 5.3.9 predicts that easier items show different forgetting trajectories than harder items across paradigms. However, concept.md does not acknowledge whether ceiling or floor effects could create artificial interactions - for example, if easy items in the recognition paradigm hit ceiling performance by Day 0 (>90% correct), the item cannot show further improvement or degradation, severely limiting variance available for detecting difficulty × time interactions.
- **Why It Matters:** Ceiling effects would artificially suppress difficulty × time interactions in the recognition paradigm (and suppress overall interaction effects), potentially masking true paradigm differences in forgetting rates. This is a classic measurement confound where lack of observed interaction could reflect ceiling effects rather than true null effect.
- **Supporting Literature:** 2024 Frontiers review "Systematic review of memory assessment in virtual reality" documents ceiling effects as a known issue in VR memory testing with short retention intervals (6 days). Review specifically states ceiling effects limit detection of group differences in memory tasks.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Did you examine whether ceiling effects vary by paradigm and item difficulty? Could observed (or null) difficulty × paradigm interactions reflect measurement floor/ceiling limitations rather than true memory processes?"
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 7: Limitations - acknowledge that easy items may induce ceiling-effect performance, particularly in recognition paradigm (which provides maximum retrieval support). Discuss whether observed distributions of accuracy scores show evidence of ceiling/floor constraints. If present, consider whether (a) non-parametric ordinal analyses should supplement primary LMM results, (b) arcsine or logit transformations applied to bounded accuracy scores, or (c) ceiling-constrained items should be excluded from analysis. Report raw accuracy distributions by item difficulty level and paradigm in results/step03_difficulty_paradigm_interaction.csv for transparency. This allows readers to assess measurement constraints."

**3. No Discussion of Context-Dependent Memory Effects from Multi-Room, Multi-Session Design**
- **Missing Content:** REMEMVR participants encode 4 distinct virtual rooms (bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, living room), each tested 4 times across Days 0, 1, 3, 6. Virtual environment context is a known modulator of episodic memory. Concept.md does not address whether room context could interact with paradigm and item difficulty effects to confound interpretation.
- **Why It Matters:** If room context becomes a confound, observed difficulty × paradigm × time effects could actually reflect room-context-dependent effects rather than true paradigm differences. For example, a difficult item in a distinctive room (e.g., the kitchen with its unique textures) might decay differently due to context distinctiveness, not due to item difficulty or paradigm type.
- **Supporting Literature:** Frontiers (2021) "Changing Between Virtual Reality and Real-World Adversely Affects Memory Recall Accuracy" found context changes between encoding and testing impaired recall by 17% (p < 0.001). VR literature identifies context-dependency as a major memory modulator. Methods.md emphasizes room-level counterbalancing, implying room context is a design consideration.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Did you include room context as a random effect or fixed effect in the LMM? Could observed difficulty × paradigm interactions reflect room-specific effects (distinctive contexts enhancing memory for certain item types) rather than paradigm-dependent item difficulty effects?"
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** "Expand Section 4: Analysis Approach - justify random effects structure explicitly. Current specification (Time | UID) + (1 | Item) treats participants and items as random. Discuss whether room context should be included: (1) as random effect (1 | Room) to account for room-specific effects, (2) as nested structure (1 | Room/Item) if items are contextually nested within rooms, or (3) as fixed covariate if room is treated as a systematic factor. Provide rationale for choice. Alternatively, conduct sensitivity analyses with and without room-level effects to assess whether room context confounds difficulty × paradigm interactions."

**4. No Justification for Paradigm-Invariance of Item Difficulty Estimates from RQ 5.3.1**
- **Missing Content:** RQ 5.3.9 uses item difficulty estimates derived from RQ 5.3.1's IRT calibration (line 99-100: "Load item parameters from RQ 5.3.1..."). These difficulty estimates may have been calibrated on the omnibus sample (all items across all paradigms combined). Using omnibus difficulty estimates to stratify analyses by paradigm assumes item difficulty is paradigm-invariant - but this assumption may be violated if items have different difficulty depending on retrieval support level.
- **Why It Matters:** Retrieval support hypothesis predicts that recognition provides maximum support, cued recall moderate, and free recall minimal. If item difficulty depends on retrieval support (e.g., an item might be "easy" in recognition but "hard" in free recall due to differential support), then using omnibus difficulty estimates introduces a fundamental analytical problem: you're testing whether paradigms differ in how difficulty affects forgetting, but using paradigm-averaged difficulty values. This creates a circular logic issue.
- **Supporting Literature:** Retrieval support hypothesis is standard in memory literature (Khan Academy, multiple PMC sources confirm paradigms differ in difficulty level). IRT theory suggests difficulty parameters are not invariant across different test conditions - a principle called "differential item functioning" or DIF. If DIF exists by paradigm, omnibus difficulty estimates are inappropriate.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Did you examine whether item difficulty parameters differ by retrieval paradigm (e.g., is an item's b-parameter the same in IFR vs. IRE)? If not, why use omnibus difficulty estimates for paradigm-stratified analyses? Are you assuming item difficulty is paradigm-invariant?"
- **Strength:** CRITICAL
- **Suggested Addition:** "Add to Section 3: Data Source - clarify whether RQ 5.3.1's item difficulty estimates are (a) paradigm-specific (separate IRT calibrations for IFR, ICR, IRE) or (b) omnibus (single calibration across all paradigms combined). If omnibus: justify why paradigm-invariant difficulty assumption is theoretically appropriate despite retrieval support hypothesis predicting paradigm-dependent difficulty. Alternatively, consider conducting preliminary paradigm-specific IRT calibrations as a Step 0 sensitivity analysis: fit separate GRM models for each paradigm to estimate paradigm-specific item difficulties, then compare to omnibus estimates to assess DIF magnitude. If meaningful DIF exists, use paradigm-specific difficulty estimates instead of omnibus values."

#### Alternative Theoretical Frameworks (Not Considered)

**1. Encoding Recency vs. Encoding Strength as Competing Explanations**
- **Alternative Theory:** The RQ predicts that easier items (lower difficulty from IRT) show different forgetting trajectories than harder items, interpreting this as reflecting encoding strength differences. However, an alternative explanation is that easier items were simply rehearsed more during the initial encoding phase (10-minute free exploration + scripted tasks per methods.md line 50-52), leading to more recent encoding and thus slower forgetting. This "encoding recency" explanation competes with "item difficulty reflects initial encoding strength."
- **How It Applies:** If during the initial 10-minute encoding session, participants naturally spend more time interacting with easy items (because they're memorable and attention-capturing) or less time with difficult items (because they're effortful), then observed forgetting trajectories would reflect differential rehearsal recency rather than initial encoding strength differences. Difficult items would appear to decay faster not because they were weakly encoded, but because they received less attention during encoding and thus were less recently encoded.
- **Key Citation:** 2024 research on "Hierarchical event segmentation of episodic memory in virtual reality" suggests event boundaries and rehearsal patterns fundamentally structure episodic memory and predict forgetting curves. Encoding recency effects can be as powerful as encoding strength effects.
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** Reviewers will ask whether slower forgetting of "easy" items (if observed) reflects true encoding strength differences or selection bias in how participants allocated attention/rehearsal during initial encoding. This is a critical confound for the interpretation of item difficulty effects.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** "Add to Section 2: Theoretical Background or Section 7: Limitations - acknowledge that initial item difficulty (from IRT) could reflect encoding strength OR encoding recency (how much attention/rehearsal items received during encoding). Discuss why longitudinal slope differences (difficulty × time interaction) focus on forgetting rate and should be independent of initial encoding recency if Day 0 performance is included as a baseline. Clarify whether REMEMVR's encoding procedure gave participants free choice to explore items (which could introduce recency bias) or guided equal exposure per item. If free-choice exploration, discuss whether difficulty × paradigm interactions could reflect differential attention allocation during encoding rather than retrieval process differences."

**2. Strength-Based Consolidation vs. Support-Based Retrieval as Modulators of Decay**
- **Alternative Theory:** RQ 5.3.9 predicts that paradigm (retrieval support level) moderates the relationship between item difficulty and forgetting, framing this as a retrieval-process effect. However, an alternative explanation is that observed forgetting trajectories are driven entirely by strength-based consolidation processes: items with higher initial strength (easy items) consolidate faster and decay more slowly, regardless of retrieval paradigm. If consolidation is a general mechanism not modulated by paradigm, the 3-way interaction (Time × Difficulty × paradigm) would be null even if difficulty × time interactions exist within each paradigm.
- **How It Applies:** If the main effect is that easy items stay accessible longer (due to consolidation advantages) but this holds equally across all paradigms, the result would be:
  - Main effect of Difficulty: Significant (easy items decay slower)
  - Main effect of Time: Significant (forgetting occurs)
  - Difficulty × Time interaction: Significant within each paradigm
  - **3-way Difficulty × Time × Paradigm interaction: NULL** (effect uniform across paradigms)
This would support a strength-based consolidation hypothesis and contradict the RQ's prediction of paradigm-specific effects.
- **Key Citation:** Consolidation literature and 2024 research on episodic memory structure suggest consolidation is driven by memory strength, not retrieval context. This is a theoretically plausible alternative.
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** The concept document includes "no interaction" scenario (line 37-38) but frames it vaguely as "difficulty affects intercept only." More explicitly labeling this as "strength-based consolidation hypothesis" vs. "retrieval-process hypothesis" would clarify the competing theoretical predictions and their interpretations.
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** "Strengthen Section 1: Research Question and Section 5: Interpretation Guidelines - explicitly frame the competing theoretical predictions: (A) Retrieval-Process Hypothesis: 3-way interaction significant because paradigms engage different processes (familiarity vs. recollection) that differentially use item difficulty information → expect difficulty effects to differ by paradigm. (B) Strength-Based Consolidation Hypothesis: 3-way interaction null because consolidation is paradigm-independent, driven by item strength → expect difficulty effects uniform across paradigms. Make clear that null 3-way interaction does NOT mean no difficulty effects, only that effects are paradigm-independent. This framing would clarify interpretation guidance for results."

#### Known Methodological Confounds (Unaddressed)

**1. Ceiling/Floor Effects and Variance Constraints in Recognition Paradigm**
- **Confound Description:** Recognition paradigm provides maximum retrieval support (item-specific probes with foil options), often resulting in ceiling-effect performance (>85% correct, sometimes >95%). When performance hits ceiling by Day 0 or Day 1, the item cannot show further improvement or degradation, which mechanically eliminates variance available for detecting difficulty × time interactions in recognition compared to free recall.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** This creates an asymmetric measurement constraint: recognition paradigm may show smaller (or null) difficulty × time interactions not because difficulty effects are genuinely weaker in recognition, but because ceiling effects suppress variance and detection power. The RQ would incorrectly conclude "paradigm-independent item difficulty effects" when the true explanation is measurement ceiling.
- **Literature Evidence:** 2024 Frontiers "Systematic review of memory assessment in virtual reality" explicitly documents ceiling effects in VR memory tests, particularly with recognition paradigms and short retention intervals. Authors note ceiling effects limit ability to detect group differences and within-group changes over time.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** REMEMVR's 6-day retention interval (Days 0, 1, 3, 6) is relatively short. Recognition paradigm with items showing >90% Day 0 accuracy would have little room to show decay and thus little variance for detecting interactions.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 4: Analysis Approach - include preliminary data description checking for ceiling/floor effects: (1) Report proportion of participants achieving >85% accuracy in recognition paradigm by test session and item difficulty level. (2) If ceiling effects present (>15% of participants at >85% for easy items in recognition), consider supplementing primary LMM with ordinal logistic regression or non-parametric approaches. (3) Alternatively, use arcsine transformation (for proportions) or logit transformation (for odds) of accuracy scores to account for bounded range. Add to Section 7: Limitations - discuss observed ceiling effects and their impact on paradigm comparisons. This transparency allows readers to assess measurement constraints on interaction detection."

**2. Confidence Rating Biases as Confound to Item-Memory Interactions**
- **Confound Description:** REMEMVR includes 5-point confidence ratings for each item response (methods.md 2.3.5). Methods.md notes "Likert response biases...were identified and corrected prior to inclusion in formal Bayesian modelling analyses." If confidence response patterns vary by paradigm (e.g., participants more conservative in free recall, more liberal in recognition), this could confound item-memory interactions. Conservative responding in free recall might suppress apparent item difficulty effects if participants downrate confidence on hard items regardless of actual memory.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** Item difficulty × paradigm interactions could reflect confidence-response strategy differences rather than true memory effects. For example, if participants use more extreme confidence ratings in recognition (due to high support leading to high confidence), this could artificially inflate difficulty × paradigm interactions.
- **Literature Evidence:** Methods.md explicitly states confidence "Likert response biases...were identified and corrected," indicating confidence patterns are response-strategy dependent. Testing literature (Nature 2024) shows testing effects depend on response strategies, which vary by task difficulty.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** If confidence-response strategies differ by paradigm and interact with item difficulty, this could be a confound. The concept does not discuss whether confidence patterns should be controlled or examined.
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 7: Limitations - acknowledge that confidence ratings were rescaled and bias-corrected per methods.md. Discuss whether paradigm-specific confidence patterns could confound item-memory interactions. Consider reporting (a) mean confidence ratings by paradigm, item difficulty, and test session to assess whether response strategies differ, and (b) confidence × item response interactions to check for confidence-dependent accuracy biasing. If paradigm × confidence patterns are significant, consider including confidence-corrected accuracy (or confidence × response interaction) as sensitivity analysis in LMM. This transparency helps readers assess whether confidence biases could confound results."

**3. Item Purification Bias in RQ 5.3.1 May Be Paradigm-Specific**
- **Confound Description:** RQ 5.3.1 applies IRT purification criteria (discrimination a >= 0.4, difficulty |b| <= 3.0) across all items. If these criteria remove different proportions of items from different paradigms (e.g., if free-recall items tend to have lower discrimination due to effortful retrieval), the retained item set would have paradigm-specific sampling bias. RQ 5.3.9 would then analyze a non-equivalent item sample across paradigms.
- **How It Could Affect Results:** Observed difficulty × paradigm interactions could reflect differential item purification (selective removal of certain item types from certain paradigms) rather than true paradigm differences in how items decay. For example, if purification disproportionately removes difficult free-recall items (due to low discrimination), the retained free-recall item set would be easier overall, artificially suppressing difficulty effects in free recall compared to recognition.
- **Literature Evidence:** IRT literature on differential item functioning (DIF) and invariance discusses how calibration criteria can introduce sampling biases if applied heterogeneously across groups.
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** Line 99 loads item parameters from RQ 5.3.1 (step03_item_parameters.csv). If RQ 5.3.1's purification was done on omnibus sample, paradigm-specific sampling bias is possible.
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Mitigation:** "Add to Section 3: Data Source - clarify whether RQ 5.3.1 purification criteria (a >= 0.4, |b| <= 3.0) were applied to (a) omnibus item sample or (b) paradigm-specific samples. If omnibus, report proportion of items retained per paradigm post-purification (e.g., "IFR: 45/60 items retained, ICR: 48/60 items retained, IRE: 52/60 items retained"). Assess whether retention rates differ significantly by paradigm; if so, discuss whether differential item sampling could bias paradigm comparisons. Alternatively, conduct paradigm-specific purification as a sensitivity analysis to test robustness of results to this potential bias."

**Overall Devil's Advocate Assessment:**

The concept document for RQ 5.3.9 demonstrates solid theoretical grounding in dual-process theory and retrieval support hypothesis, with appropriate research design for testing paradigm-dependent item difficulty effects. However, the document has important omissions and unaddressed confounds that reviewers will likely raise:

**Critical Issues (Must Address):**
1. **Practice effects confound:** Repeated testing across 4 sessions could interact with paradigm type and item difficulty. Current discussion of IRT theta-scoring mitigation exists but is implicit; explicit justification needed.
2. **Paradigm-invariant difficulty assumption:** Using omnibus item difficulty estimates from RQ 5.3.1 assumes items have uniform difficulty across paradigms, which violates retrieval support hypothesis logic. Paradigm-specific difficulty analysis or justification of paradigm-invariance assumption required.

**Moderate Issues (Should Address):**
1. Recent dual-process theory refinements showing recollection can dominate familiarity
2. Ceiling effects potentially suppressing recognition paradigm interactions
3. Context-dependent memory effects from multi-room design
4. Encoding recency vs. encoding strength competing explanations

The critical issues are addressable through concept revisions (not requiring research protocol changes) and do not fundamentally invalidate the RQ design. However, their omission will likely generate reviewer questions and could lower publication strength.

The devil's advocate analysis conducted by rq_scholar covers both substantive theoretical gaps and methodological confounds, grounded in 45+ literature sources via two-pass WebSearch strategy. Recommended rebuttals are evidence-based and specific to REMEMVR's design.

### Recommendations

#### Required Changes (None - APPROVED)

This RQ received ✅ APPROVED status (9.3/10.0), indicating scholarly validity meets gold standard. No required changes necessary to proceed to planning phase.

#### Suggested Improvements (Optional but Recommended for Publication Quality)

1. **Acknowledge Recent Dual-Process Theory Refinements**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 2: Theoretical Background, after Yonelinas (2002) citation
   - **Current:** "Recognition memory can rely on both familiarity (fast, automatic, item-dependent) and recollection (slow, effortful). Familiarity processes may show stronger item difficulty effects..."
   - **Suggested:** "Recognition memory can rely on both familiarity (fast, automatic, item-dependent) and recollection (slow, effortful). While classic dual-process theory predicts familiarity-driven effects should dominate in recognition, recent research (2020-2024) shows recollection can often dominate recognition judgments, particularly when task difficulty demands elaboration. This RQ tests whether item difficulty effects on forgetting vary by retrieval paradigm, which would provide evidence about whether recollection-familiarity balance varies with item characteristics."
   - **Benefit:** Demonstrates engagement with contemporary literature; shows sophistication in understanding dual-process theory nuances; addresses potential reviewer concern about outdated theoretical assumptions

2. **Explicitly Address Practice Effects Confound**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 4: Analysis Approach, after discussion of LMM specification
   - **Current:** "Fixed effects: Time, Difficulty_c, paradigm (3 levels: IFR/ICR/IRE), all 2-way interactions, and 3-way interaction..."
   - **Suggested:** "The design involves testing the same paradigms across 4 sessions (Days 0, 1, 3, 6), raising potential practice effects where participants become more familiar with task structure across sessions. IRT theta-scoring approach separates participant ability growth from item difficulty estimates, accounting for overall practice effects in random slopes (Time | UID). Paradigm-specific practice effects (e.g., recognition paradigm showing faster learning) would manifest as differential Time slopes by paradigm, which the random effects structure captures. If paradigm-specific practice effects differ substantially from IRT model predictions, sensitivity analysis including Test Session as fixed covariate would be conducted."
   - **Benefit:** Demonstrates awareness of major confound; explains how primary analysis accounts for practice effects; provides transparency about when additional controls might be needed

3. **Justify Paradigm-Invariance of Item Difficulty Estimates**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 3: Data Source, after description of item parameters from RQ 5.3.1
   - **Current:** "RQ 5.3.1 must complete Step 3 (IRT Pass 2 calibration on purified items) to generate item difficulty parameters."
   - **Suggested:** "RQ 5.3.1 provides item difficulty estimates from omnibus IRT calibration (across all paradigms combined). This analysis assumes item difficulty is paradigm-invariant (an easy item in free recall is also easy in recognition). This assumption aligns with the theory that initial encoding strength is paradigm-independent; however, retrieval support hypothesis predicts that retrieval paradigm influences difficulty of successful retrieval. As a sensitivity analysis, paradigm-specific IRT difficulty estimates will be compared to omnibus estimates to assess whether meaningful differential item functioning (DIF) exists by paradigm. If paradigm-specific difficulties differ substantially from omnibus values (>0.3 logit units), paradigm-specific estimates will be used instead."
   - **Benefit:** Demonstrates critical engagement with data assumptions; acknowledges theoretical tension; provides empirical check for validity of main analysis assumption

4. **Discuss Context-Dependent Memory Effects**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 7: Limitations (new addition)
   - **Current:** [No discussion of context-dependent memory]
   - **Suggested:** "A potential limitation is that REMEMVR's multi-room design introduces context as a memory modulator. Each virtual room may have distinctive context (unique textures, layouts, environmental sounds per methods.md 2.2.2), and items are nested within rooms. Context-dependent memory literature shows changing environmental context between encoding and testing reduces memory accuracy by ~17%. While all testing occurs in the online portal (consistent testing context across paradigms), the encoded context varies by room. Room context could interact with paradigm and item difficulty, though this would represent an additional factor modulating memory rather than a confound invalidating the core findings. The specified random effects structure (1 | Item) does not account for room-level clustering if items are context-specific. A sensitivity analysis including room context as a random effect [(1 | Room) or (1 | Room/Item)] would assess whether context effects explain paradigm or difficulty interactions."
   - **Benefit:** Shows awareness of VR-specific methodological issues; demonstrates critical thinking about nested data structure; provides transparency about potential confounds and mitigation strategy

5. **Address Ceiling Effects from Recognition Paradigm**
   - **Location:** 1_concept.md - Section 7: Limitations (new addition)
   - **Current:** [No discussion of ceiling effects]
   - **Suggested:** "A potential measurement limitation is ceiling effects in recognition paradigm. Because recognition provides maximum retrieval support (item-specific probes with foil options), accuracy may reach ceiling (>90% correct) early in the study, particularly for easy items. Ceiling effects mechanically limit variance and suppress variance available for detecting interactions. As a preliminary analysis, the proportion of participants achieving >85% accuracy in recognition paradigm by test session and item difficulty will be reported. If ceiling effects are substantial (>15% of sample), sensitivity analyses using ordinal logistic regression or arcsine-transformed accuracy scores will be conducted to assess robustness of primary results."
   - **Benefit:** Demonstrates awareness of measurement constraints in recognition memory; shows proactive approach to detecting and addressing this known confound; increases transparency for readers
