    RQ 5.5.7: Source-Destination Clustering
    Type: Source-Destination / Clustering
    Analysis: K-means (K=1-6 BIC selection) + quality validation (Silhouette/DB/Jaccard)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.5.6 random effects (100 × 4 features)
    Critical: Weak quality expected (Silhouette<0.40), stable groupings (Jaccard>0.60)

rq_scholar:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.3/10.0 APPROVED. Strong theory (dimensional model, replication logic). Add LPA alternative, Parsons 2024 + cognotyping 2023 cites, clarify Jaccard thresholds."

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.3/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 2.8/3 (K-means appropriate, spherical assumption concern). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 2.0/2 (comprehensive). Cat4: 1.8/2 (triple validation, missing assumption checks). Cat5: 0.7/1 (9 concerns, adequate)."

    Analysis plan created: 7 steps planned (Step 0: load data + Steps 1-6: standardize, select, validate, fit, characterize, visualize).
    Tool requirements: K-means clustering (K=1-6, BIC selection), triple validation (Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, Jaccard bootstrap).
    Expected outputs: 10 data files, 7 logs, 1 plot source CSV. Validation required at every step.

    All 7 analysis steps executed successfully
    Step 00: Loaded 200 rows from RQ 5.5.6, reshaped to 100x5
    Step 01: Z-score standardization (mean=0, SD=1)
    Step 02: K-means BIC selection, optimal K=4
    Step 03: Quality validation - Silhouette=0.417 PASS, DB=0.785 PASS, Jaccard=0.831 PASS
    Step 04: Final K-means with K=4, cluster sizes [20, 26, 35, 19]
    Step 05: Cluster characterization with interpretive labels
    Step 06: Plot data prepared (100 rows, 4 clusters)
    NOTABLE: Clustering quality BETTER than expected (Silhouette > 0.40)
