  r(Full CTT, Purified CTT) = 0.957
  Delta r (Purified - Full) = +0.022
  Steiger's z = -1.466
  p (uncorrected) = 0.1426
  p (Bonferroni) = 0.4277
  [WARNING] Normality assumption violated

[DIMENSION] Congruent
  r(theta, Full CTT) = 0.786
  r(theta, Purified CTT) = 0.882
  r(Full CTT, Purified CTT) = 0.924
  Delta r (Purified - Full) = +0.096

  [WARNING] Normality assumption violated

[DIMENSION] Incongruent
  r(theta, Full CTT) = 0.799
  r(theta, Purified CTT) = 0.907
  r(Full CTT, Purified CTT) = 0.864
  Delta r (Purified - Full) = +0.108
  Steiger's z = -4.010
  p (uncorrected) = 0.0001
  p (Bonferroni) = 0.0002
  [WARNING] Normality assumption violated

[VALIDATION] Checking correlations in [-1, 1]
[PASS] All correlations in valid range
[VALIDATION] Checking p_bonferroni = min(p_uncorrected * 3, 1.0)
[PASS] Bonferroni correction verified
