    RQ 5.4.5: Purified CTT Effects
    Type: Congruence / Purified CTT Effects
    Analysis: CTT score comparison + Correlation + LMM
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.1 (purified items, theta, TSVR)
    Critical: Full vs Purified CTT convergence, Steiger's z-test

    9.35/10 APPROVED. Rubric: Theory 2.8/3.0 (schema + CTT-IRT solid), Lit 1.9/2.0 (recent 2024 papers found), Interp 2.0/2.0 (scenarios complete), Impl 2.0/2.0 (clear contributions), Devil 0.85/1.0 (practice effects omission critical but addressable). 4 literature additions recommended, 5 suggested improvements for robustness.

  context_dump: |
    9.1/10 CONDITIONAL. Category 1: 2.9/3.0 (appropriate methods, strong). Category 2: 2.0/2.0 (100% tool reuse, excellent). Category 3: 1.9/2.0 (parameters specified, z-standardization rationale implicit). Category 4: 1.8/2.0 (validation procedures specified, missing assumption checks). Category 5: 0.5/1.0 (10 concerns identified, partial devil's advocate coverage). Key strength: Steiger's z-test + Cronbach's alpha + LMM comparison appropriate for convergence RQ. Key weakness: Missing explicit normality checks, construct comparability validation, missing data handling, power analysis. Requires 3 critical additions for approval.
