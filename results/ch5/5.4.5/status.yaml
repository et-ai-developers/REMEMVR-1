    RQ 5.4.5: Purified CTT Effects
    Type: Congruence / Purified CTT Effects
    Analysis: CTT score comparison + Correlation + LMM
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.1 (purified items, theta, TSVR)
    Critical: Full vs Purified CTT convergence, Steiger's z-test

    9.35/10 APPROVED. Rubric: Theory 2.8/3.0 (schema + CTT-IRT solid), Lit 1.9/2.0 (recent 2024 papers found), Interp 2.0/2.0 (scenarios complete), Impl 2.0/2.0 (clear contributions), Devil 0.85/1.0 (practice effects omission critical but addressable). 4 literature additions recommended, 5 suggested improvements for robustness.

    9.5/10 APPROVED (UPDATED). Category 1: 3.0/3.0 (exceptional, z-standardization now explicit). Category 2: 2.0/2.0 (100% tool reuse). Category 3: 2.0/2.0 (z-standardization rationale fully specified). Category 4: 1.9/2.0 (bivariate normality + missing data handling added). Category 5: 0.6/1.0 (proactive addressing of criticisms). Original 9.1 CONDITIONAL upgraded to 9.5 APPROVED after additions: Z-Standardization Rationale (lines 121-139), Bivariate Normality Check (lines 140-147), Missing Data Handling (lines 148-157), Practice Effects Acknowledgment (lines 159-164). All 3 critical additions from original report implemented. Ready for rq_planner.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9 steps planned (Step 0: dependency verification + Steps 1-8: analysis)
    Tool requirements: CTT computation, Cronbach's alpha, Steiger's z-test, z-standardization, parallel LMMs, plot data prep
    Expected outputs: 14 data files, 9 logs, 2 plot source CSVs (correlation + AIC comparison)
    Validation: Mandatory per-step validation, dual p-values (D068), z-score criteria (mean~0, SD~1)

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    4 analysis + 6 validation tools cataloged for CTT convergence analysis
    Analysis: check_file_exists, compute_cronbachs_alpha, compare_correlations_dependent, fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr
    Validation: validate_data_columns, validate_numeric_range, validate_correlation_test_d068, validate_standardization, validate_lmm_convergence, validate_dataframe_structure
    All tools verified in tools_inventory.md (CTT module tools documented)
    Decision D068 dual p-value validation included (Steiger's z-test)

rq_analysis:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9 steps specified with validation (CTT convergence: Full vs Purified)
    Step types: 1 catalogued dependency check + 4 stdlib data ops + 3 catalogued statistical tests + 1 stdlib plot prep
    All steps have paired validation tools (4 catalogued + 5 stdlib inline validation)
    Decisions embedded: D039 (purification), D068 (dual p-values), D070 (TSVR time)
    Output folder compliance: 14 CSV files to data/, 9 log files to logs/, 2 plot source CSVs to data/
