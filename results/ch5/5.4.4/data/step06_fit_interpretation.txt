Model Fit Comparison - RQ 5.4.4
============================================================

IRT Model: AIC = 2529.98, BIC = 2596.15
CTT Model: AIC = -1077.45, BIC = -1011.28

Delta AIC (IRT - CTT): 3607.43

IMPORTANT CAVEAT:
AIC and BIC are NOT directly comparable across models with different
dependent variables (theta scale vs proportion correct scale). The large
difference reflects scale differences, not model quality differences.

The key convergence metrics are:
1. Correlations (Step 02): All r > 0.70 - PASSED
2. Cohen's kappa (Step 05): kappa > 0.60 - PASSED
3. Percent agreement (Step 05): > 80% - PASSED

Both models converged with identical random structure (random slopes on log_TSVR).
