    RQ 5.4.4: IRT-CTT Convergence
    Type: Congruence / IRT-CTT Convergence
    Analysis: Correlation + Parallel LMMs (IRT vs CTT)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.1 (theta, purified items, TSVR)
    Critical: Convergence validation, r>0.70, kappa>0.60, dual p-values D068

    9.4/10 APPROVED (re-validated 2025-12-02, upgraded from 8.9/10 CONDITIONAL). Cat1: 2.9/3 (random slopes protocol operationalized). Cat2: 1.9/2 (kappa implementation clarified). Cat3: 1.9/2 (sample sizes & kappa categories specified). Cat4: 1.9/2 (validation procedures confirmed). Cat5: 0.8/1 (13 concerns; 4-5 directly addressed by concept updates). Three new sections: Cohen's Kappa Implementation, Sample Size Per Category, Random Simplification Strategy. All 3 CONDITIONAL requirements resolved.
