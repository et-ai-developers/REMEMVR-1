    RQ 5.1.6: Item Difficulty Interaction
    Type: General / Item Difficulty Interaction
    Analysis: Cross-classified binomial GLMM (pymer4) with Time x Difficulty_c interaction
    Data: DERIVED item parameters from RQ 5.2.1 + RAW responses from dfData.csv
    Critical: Exploratory (3 competing predictions), alpha=0.05, item-level long format (~28k-42k obs), binomial family with logit link

rq_scholar:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.3/10 APPROVED. Theory strong (exploratory 3-prediction framework), literature adequate (needs Sadeh 2018 null finding), interpretation excellent, implications clear, devil's advocate comprehensive (10 concerns, all MODERATE/MINOR). 5 suggested improvements (optional)."

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.4/10 APPROVED. Category 1: 2.9/3 (binomial GLMM appropriate, nAGQ/fallback minor refinements). Category 2: 1.6/2 (57% tool reuse, 3 missing GLMM tools). Category 3: 2.0/2 (complete parameter specification). Category 4: 2.0/2 (comprehensive GLMM diagnostics). Category 5: 0.9/1 (8 concerns across 4 subsections, literature-grounded)."

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 8 steps (Step 0: load dependencies -> Step 7: plot data preparation).
    Tool requirements: pymer4 binomial GLMM (crossed random effects), item difficulty centering, model predictions (probability scale).
    Expected outputs: 15 data files (item difficulty, response data, merged data, centered difficulty, GLMM summary, diagnostics, interaction results, plot data), 8 log files.
    Critical: Cross-classified structure (UID | item_name), 4-tier convergence fallback, GLMM diagnostics (overdispersion, RE normality), no IRT calibration (uses RQ 5.2.1 parameters).

  context_dump: |
    FAIL - Missing GLMM Tools (6 tools not in tools_inventory.md)
    Required: fit_binomial_glmm, validate_glmm_convergence, validate_glmm_overdispersion
    Analysis: Cross-classified binomial GLMM (pymer4) for Time x Difficulty interaction
    Action: TDD migration needed - create GLMM module + update tools_inventory.md
