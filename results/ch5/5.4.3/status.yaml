    RQ 5.4.3: Age × Schema Interactions
    Type: Congruence / Age × Schema Interactions
    Analysis: LMM with 3-way Age × Congruence × Time interaction
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.1 theta scores (400 rows wide -> 1200 long)
    Critical: Bonferroni alpha=0.025, dual p-values, Tukey HSD post-hoc

    RQ 5.4.3 RE-VALIDATED APPROVED 9.9/10. Cat1: 3.0/3.0 (convergence plan). Cat2: 2.0/2.0 (100% reuse). Cat3: 2.0/2.0 (contrast coding added). Cat4: 2.0/2.0 (remedial actions added). Cat5: 0.9/1.0 (3 critical issues resolved). Concept successfully addressed all 3 required changes. Ready for rq_planner.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 6 steps planned (Step 0: dependency validation + Steps 1-5: analysis).
    Tool requirements: LMM fitting (3-way Age x Congruence x Time), marginal effects (delta method), Tukey HSD contrasts, age tertile aggregation.
    Expected outputs: 11 data files, 6 log files. Validation required at every step.

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    6 analysis + 6 validation tools cataloged for LMM-only Age x Schema analysis
    LMM tools: fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr, extract_marginal_age_slopes_by_domain, prepare_age_effects_plot_data
    Standard library: pandas (load_dependency_files, merge_and_reshape, extract_interaction_terms)
    Validation: comprehensive LMM assumptions, dual p-values (D068), plot data completeness
    All tools verified against tools_inventory.md, all naming conventions verified against names.md

rq_analysis:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    6 steps specified with validation (LMM-only Age x Schema analysis)
    Step 0: Load dependencies (RQ 5.4.1 theta, TSVR, master Age)
    Steps 1-5: Prepare LMM input, fit 3-way interaction, extract terms, age effects + Tukey, plot data
    All steps have analysis + validation calls, all signatures complete with type hints

rq_inspect:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    All 6 steps PASS 4-layer validation (Existence, Structure, Substance, Log)
    NULL RESULT: No significant Age x Schema interactions (all p_bonferroni > 0.025)
    Decision D068 compliance: Dual p-values for all hypothesis tests
    Decision D070 compliance: TSVR hours used correctly throughout

rq_plots:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Plot generated: age_congruence_trajectories.png (3-panel: Young/Middle/Older)
    Data source: step05_age_effects_plot_data.csv (36 rows: 3 tertiles x 3 congruence x 4 tests)
    Visualization: Age-specific trajectories across Common/Congruent/Incongruent schema conditions
    NULL finding annotated: No significant Age x Congruence x Time interactions

  timestamp: 2025-12-09T14:13:00Z
  context_dump: |
    Results validated for scientific plausibility (Recip+Log two-process model)
    NULL RESULT ROBUST: All 4 three-way interactions p_bonferroni > 0.025 (range: 0.249-1.000)
    Summary updated in results/summary.md (5 sections, updated for Recip+Log functional form)
    Two-process findings: Rapid (recip_TSVR β=-1.21) + Slow (log_TSVR β=-0.34) forgetting, age-invariant
    0 anomalies flagged (plausibility checks passed, visual-statistical coherence excellent)
