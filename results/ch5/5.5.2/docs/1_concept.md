# RQ 5.5.2: Source-Destination Consolidation

**Chapter:** 5
**Type:** Source-Destination
**Subtype:** Consolidation (Two-Phase Test)
**Full ID:** 5.5.2

---

## Research Question

**Primary Question:**
Do source (-U-) and destination (-D-) memories show different consolidation patterns across the Early (Day 0-1) and Late (Day 1-6) retention periods?

**Scope:**
Tests whether the piecewise forgetting model differs between source and destination spatial memories. Uses methodology from RQ 5.2.2, 5.3.3, 5.4.2 (consolidation RQs for other factor structures).

---

## Theoretical Background

**Relevant Theories:**
- Sleep-dependent consolidation may differentially affect source vs destination memories
- If destination memories are encoded with less semantic support, they may benefit less from consolidation
- Alternatively, weaker traces may show proportionally greater consolidation benefit (ceiling effect for strong traces)

**Predictions:**
- If destination encoding is weaker, it may show faster Early decay and/or less Late stabilization
- Expected: Location Type x Phase interaction, with -D- showing steeper Early slope

---

## Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis:**
Destination memory (-D-) will show steeper Early-phase forgetting than source memory (-U-), but similar Late-phase stabilization (3-way interaction: Location Type x Phase x Time).

**Secondary Hypotheses:**
1. Both location types will show significant consolidation benefit (Early slope > Late slope)
2. The consolidation pattern matches RQ 5.1.2 overall pattern

---

## Analysis Approach

**Design:**
- Piecewise LMM with breakpoint at 48 hours (Days 0-1 vs Days 1-6)
- Factor: Location Type (2 levels: -U-, -D-)
- Test: Location Type x Phase x Time 3-way interaction

**Dependencies:**
- RQ 5.5.1 MUST be complete (provides best-fit model, purified items)

## Notes

**Matches:** RQ 5.2.2 (Domain Consolidation), 5.3.3 (Paradigm Consolidation), 5.4.2 (Congruence Consolidation)
