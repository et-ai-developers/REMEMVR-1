    RQ 5.5.2: Source-Destination Consolidation (Two-Phase)
    Type: Source-Destination / Consolidation
    Analysis: Piecewise LMM (48h breakpoint Early/Late)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.5.1 theta scores (800 obs)
    Critical: LocationType x Phase interaction tests differential consolidation

rq_scholar:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.5/10 APPROVED. Theory exceptional (3.0), lit strong (1.8), interpretation complete (2.0), implications clear (2.0). 1 CRITICAL error (sleep claim reversed). 5 suggested improvements. Ready for stats."

    8 steps planned (Step 0: load dependency + Steps 1-7: piecewise LMM analysis).
    Tool requirements: Piecewise LMM (3-way interaction), segment slope extraction, consolidation benefit tests, dual p-values (D068), dual-scale plots (D069).
    Expected outputs: 8 data files (model, slopes, consolidation benefit, interaction, plot sources), 8 log files. Validation required at every step.
