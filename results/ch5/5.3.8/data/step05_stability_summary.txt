BOOTSTRAP STABILITY ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Clustering Configuration: K=3 clusters, N=100 participants
Bootstrap Protocol: 100 iterations, 80 participants per subsample (80%)

JACCARD INDEX DISTRIBUTION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mean:        0.7142
SD:          0.1039
95% CI:      [0.5504, 0.9488]
Range:       [0.5208, 1.0000]

INTERPRETATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stability: MARGINAL - Clustering shows moderate stability

WARNING:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mean Jaccard 0.7142 is below threshold 0.75
This suggests cluster assignments are sensitive to sample composition.
Phenotypes should be interpreted as tentative and exploratory.

Possible Reasons:
  - Small sample size (N=100) limits stability
  - Clusters may overlap in feature space
  - Some participants near cluster boundaries

Recommendation:
  - Report clusters as exploratory phenotypes
  - Cross-validate with external outcomes if available
  - Consider alternative K values for robustness check
