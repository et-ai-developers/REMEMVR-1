    RQ 5.3.8: Paradigm-Based Clustering
    Type: Paradigms / Paradigm-Based Clustering
    Analysis: K-means clustering (K=1-6, BIC selection)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.3.7 random effects (6 features)
    Critical: Exploratory 2-4 profiles, paradigm-selective patterns expected

    RQ 5.3.8 validated: 9.3/10 APPROVED. Theory solid, methodology sound. 8 concerns identified (1 CRITICAL ceiling effects, 7 MODERATE remediable). Recommend BIC+silhouette robustness, ceiling effect checks, practice effects clarification. Ready for planning.

  context_dump: |
    9.4/10 APPROVED (Re-validated 2025-12-02). Cat 1: 2.9/3 (K-means well-justified with LPA comparison). Cat 2: 1.8/2 (90.9% tool reuse). Cat 3: 1.9/2 (parameters well-specified with literature thresholds). Cat 4: 1.9/2 (validation comprehensive: silhouette ≥0.5, Davies-Bouldin <1.5, Dunn index, bootstrap stability Jaccard ≥0.75, PCA sphericity check). Cat 5: 0.9/1 (prior concerns resolved - stability assessment added, validation indices specified, sphericity assumption checked, LPA alternative addressed). Upgraded from 8.5 CONDITIONAL. Ready for planning.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 8 steps planned (Step 0: load/reshape + Steps 1-7: clustering workflow).
    Tool requirements: K-means clustering (BIC selection K=2-6), standardization, quality validation (silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, Dunn), bootstrap stability (100 iterations, Jaccard >=0.75).
    Expected outputs: 16 data files (cluster assignments, centers, quality metrics, stability, characterization, plot source CSV), 8 logs. Validation required at every step.
