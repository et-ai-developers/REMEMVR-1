    RQ 5.3.8: Paradigm-Based Clustering
    Type: Paradigms / Paradigm-Based Clustering
    Analysis: K-means clustering (K=1-6, BIC selection)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.3.7 random effects (6 features)
    Critical: Exploratory 2-4 profiles, paradigm-selective patterns expected

    RQ 5.3.8 validated: 9.3/10 APPROVED. Theory solid, methodology sound. 8 concerns identified (1 CRITICAL ceiling effects, 7 MODERATE remediable). Recommend BIC+silhouette robustness, ceiling effect checks, practice effects clarification. Ready for planning.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    8.5/10 CONDITIONAL. Cat 1: 2.6/3 (K-means appropriate but BIC limitations unaddressed). Cat 2: 1.8/2 (tools available, 87.5% reuse). Cat 3: 1.6/2 (parameters specified, justifications lacking). Cat 4: 1.5/2 (basic validation present, cluster diagnostics missing). Cat 5: 1.0/1 (7 literature-cited concerns across 4 subsections). Key issues: BIC lacks theoretical basis for K-means, missing cluster stability/validation indices, LPA alternative not considered. Requires changes: add silhouette+Dunn indices, implement bootstrap stability, address sphericity assumption, justify LPA exclusion.
