    RQ 5.3.8: Paradigm-Based Clustering
    Type: Paradigms / Paradigm-Based Clustering
    Analysis: K-means clustering (K=1-6, BIC selection)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.3.7 random effects (6 features)
    Critical: Exploratory 2-4 profiles, paradigm-selective patterns expected

  context_dump: |
    RQ 5.3.8 validated: 9.3/10 APPROVED. Theory solid, methodology sound. 8 concerns identified (1 CRITICAL ceiling effects, 7 MODERATE remediable). Recommend BIC+silhouette robustness, ceiling effect checks, practice effects clarification. Ready for planning.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.4/10 APPROVED (Re-validated 2025-12-02). Cat 1: 2.9/3 (K-means well-justified with LPA comparison). Cat 2: 1.8/2 (90.9% tool reuse). Cat 3: 1.9/2 (parameters well-specified with literature thresholds). Cat 4: 1.9/2 (validation comprehensive: silhouette ≥0.5, Davies-Bouldin <1.5, Dunn index, bootstrap stability Jaccard ≥0.75, PCA sphericity check). Cat 5: 0.9/1 (prior concerns resolved - stability assessment added, validation indices specified, sphericity assumption checked, LPA alternative addressed). Upgraded from 8.5 CONDITIONAL. Ready for planning.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 8 steps planned (Step 0: load/reshape + Steps 1-7: clustering workflow).
    Tool requirements: K-means clustering (BIC selection K=2-6), standardization, quality validation (silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, Dunn), bootstrap stability (100 iterations, Jaccard >=0.75).
    Expected outputs: 16 data files (cluster assignments, centers, quality metrics, stability, characterization, plot source CSV), 8 logs. Validation required at every step.

rq_tools:

    0 analysis + 8 validation tools cataloged for K-means clustering workflow

rq_analysis:

    8 steps specified with validation (K-means clustering: load -> standardize -> select K -> fit -> validate quality -> bootstrap stability -> characterize -> plot data prep)

rq_inspect:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Validated all 8 analysis steps (step00-step07)
    K=3 clusters selected (parsimony rule: BIC[4]-BIC[3]=-0.048<2)
    Cluster sizes balanced: 33, 31, 36 (all ≥10 minimum)
    Quality metrics: silhouette=0.367 (WEAK, <0.40), DB=0.981 (PASS), Dunn=0.064 (PASS)
    Stability: mean Jaccard=0.714 (MARGINAL, <0.75), 95% CI=[0.550, 0.949]
    Finding: Weak clustering with marginal stability - tentative phenotypes only (same pattern as RQ 5.2.7 and 5.4.7)

rq_plots:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Plots generated: 2 (scatter_matrix, elbow_plot)
    Data sources: step07_scatter_matrix_data.csv, step02_elbow_plot_data.csv
    Functions: seaborn.pairplot (6x6 scatter matrix), matplotlib (BIC elbow)
    Optimal K=3 marked on elbow plot

  status: success
  timestamp: 2025-12-04T02:00:00
  context_dump: |
    Results validated for scientific plausibility
    0 anomalies flagged - plausibility acceptable (weak clustering scientifically expected)
    Summary documented in results/summary.md
    Critical finding: NO paradigm-selective profiles (hypothesis NOT supported), weak clustering consistent across all Chapter 5 RQs
