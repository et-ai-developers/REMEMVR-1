RQ 5.5.1 - Model Averaging Summary (LocationType × Time)
================================================================================

Problem: Best single model uncertainty
  Best model: Quadratic
  Akaike weight: 0.0670 (6.7%)
  Interpretation: EXTREME uncertainty

Solution: Multi-model inference (Burnham & Anderson, 2002)
  Models averaged: 13
  Effective N models: 12.32
  Cumulative weight: 54.3%

Models Used (Top 10):
   1. Quadratic                 w=0.1233
   2. Log                       w=0.1039
   3. Log10                     w=0.1039
   4. Log2                      w=0.1039
   5. SquareRoot                w=0.0869
   6. Exp_slow                  w=0.0869
   7. PowerLaw_01               w=0.0790
   8. Root_067                  w=0.0551
   9. SquareRoot+Lin            w=0.0538
  10. PowerLaw_Lin              w=0.0535

Model Composition:
  Quadratic family: 2 models
  Logarithmic family: 4 models (Ebbinghaus curves)
  Square-root family: 3 models
  Power-law family: 3 models (scale-invariant decay)
  Reciprocal family: 1 models (two-process forgetting)

Effective Functional Form:
  Dominant families: Quadratic + Logarithmic + Square-root
  Interpretation: Multiple competing forgetting processes
  LocationType interaction: Time transformation × Location effects

Robustness:
  Single-model risk: Overfitting, ignores uncertainty
  Averaged approach: Accounts for functional form uncertainty
  Ph.D. defense: Scientifically defensible foundation
