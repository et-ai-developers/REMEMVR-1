    RQ 5.5.1: Source-Destination Spatial Memory Trajectories
    Type: Source-Destination / Trajectories (ROOT)
    Analysis: IRT (2-factor GRM) + LMM (5 models)
    Data: RAW from dfData.csv, -U- and -D- location items
    Critical: Source vs Destination dissociation, 800 obs (2 location types)

    9.4/10 APPROVED. Strong theory (5 mechanisms), excellent interpretation/implications. Needs Zeigarnik replicability caveat, practice effects acknowledgment, recent citations. Ready for stats validation.

    Analysis plan created: 8 steps (Step 0: extraction, Steps 1-7: analysis)
    Tool requirements: 2-factor IRT (GRM, 2-pass D039), LMM (5 models, TSVR D070), post-hoc (dual p-values D068), plotting (dual-scale D069)
    Expected outputs: 13 data files (IRT params, theta scores, LMM results, contrasts, effect sizes, plot source CSVs). Validation mandatory all steps.

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    8 analysis + 8 validation tools cataloged for IRT->LMM trajectory analysis
    Tools: extraction, IRT (2-pass), purification, merge, LMM selection, contrasts (D068), effect sizes, plot prep (D069)
    Decisions embedded: D039 (2-pass purification), D068 (dual p-values), D069 (dual-scale plots), D070 (TSVR time)
    All tools verified in tools_inventory.md, all naming conventions verified in names.md
    Ready for rq_analysis (creates 4_analysis.yaml with step sequencing)
