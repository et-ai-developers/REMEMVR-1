    RQ 5.3.4 APPROVED 9.3/10. Strong hippocampal aging theory + paradigm predictions. 7 scholarly concerns identified (1 CRITICAL, 5 MODERATE, 2 MINOR) all addressable. Ready for rq_stats.

rq_stats:

  context_dump: |
    9.55/10 APPROVED (re-validation after concept.md updates). Cat1: 2.8/3 (appropriate). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 1.95/2 (log transform NOW documented). Cat4: 1.95/2 (6 assumption tests NOW specified + convergence LRT contingency). Cat5: 0.85/1 (11 concerns; ~82% resolved including critical gaps). All 4 prior required changes implemented: assumption diagnostics, model selection LRT, log transform rationale, Bonferroni family clarification. Ready for rq_planner.
