    RQ 5.3.3: Paradigm Consolidation Window
    Type: Paradigms / Paradigm Consolidation Window
    Analysis: Piecewise LMM (Days_within x Segment x paradigm)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.3.1, 1200 observations (100 x 4 x 3)
    Critical: 6 segment-paradigm slopes, 6 contrasts at alpha=0.0083

    RQ 5.3.3: 9.3/10 APPROVED. Theoretical grounding excellent (2.8/3), literature support strong (1.9/2), interpretation guidelines comprehensive (2/2), implications clear (2/2). One CRITICAL omission (practice effects) identified and address-able. Nine concerns total: 1 CRITICAL, 7 MODERATE. Proceed to rq_planner - suggest pre-registering practice-effects analysis.

    RQ 5.3.3: 9.5/10 APPROVED (re-validated 2025-12-02). Cat1: 2.9/3 (appropriate with validation). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% tool reuse). Cat3: 1.9/2 (parameters well-specified). Cat4: 1.8/2 (comprehensive validation + convergence). Cat5: 0.9/1 (4 MINOR concerns, all CRITICAL resolved). Updates: Section 7 validation procedures, convergence contingency plan, practice effects consideration - all major gaps now addressed.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 7 steps planned (Step 0: dependency loading + Steps 1-6: analysis).
    Tool requirements: LMM fitting (piecewise 3-way interaction), segment slope extraction, contrasts (Bonferroni), plot data prep (dual-scale).
    Expected outputs: 10 data files, 7 logs. Validation required at every step. Dependency: RQ 5.3.1 MUST complete first.

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    6 analysis + 6 validation tools cataloged for piecewise LMM consolidation analysis
    Tools: assign_piecewise_segments, fit_lmm_piecewise, extract_segment_slopes, compute_contrasts, prepare_plot_data, convert_theta_to_probability
    D068/D069/D070 compliance: dual p-values, dual-scale plots, TSVR time variable
    All tools verified exist in tools_inventory.md (stdlib exempt)
    Next: rq_analysis creates 4_analysis.yaml with step sequencing

rq_analysis:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    7 steps specified with validation (piecewise LMM consolidation window analysis)
    Steps: dependency load (step00) + segment assignment (step01) + LMM fit (step02) + slope extraction (step03) + contrasts (step04) + benefit index (step05) + plot data (step06)
    D068/D069/D070 compliance embedded: dual p-values, dual-scale plots, TSVR time variable
    All tool signatures complete, all validation calls paired with analysis
    Next: g_code generates stepNN_*.py scripts with 4-layer validation

rq_inspect:

  context_dump: |
    Validated all 7 steps (step00-step06): ALL LAYERS PASS
    Layer 1 (Existence): 10 data files + 7 logs present, all >0 bytes
    Layer 2 (Structure): All column counts/names/dtypes match plan.md
    Layer 3 (Substance): Theta [-2.4,2.8], slopes [-0.42,-0.10], probs [0.27,0.65], D068/D069 compliant
    Layer 4 (Execution): Convergence=True, validation markers present, 0 errors

    Generated piecewise_trajectory.png (592 KB, 300 DPI)
    2x2 layout: Early/Late segments x theta/probability scales (D069 compliant)
    Added plot_piecewise_trajectory() to tools/plotting.py for this RQ

    Results validated for scientific plausibility
    1 anomaly flagged: Unexpected pattern (ICR>IFR>IRE ranking contradicts hypothesis, but non-significant)
    Summary documented in results/summary.md
    CRITICAL limitation: Practice effects confound per rq_scholar (4-session design)
