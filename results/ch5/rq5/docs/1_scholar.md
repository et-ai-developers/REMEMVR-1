### Detailed Rubric Evaluation

#### 1. Theoretical Grounding (2.9 / 3.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Alignment with episodic memory theory (schema theory, consolidation)
- [x] Domain-specific theoretical rationale (congruence categories, not WWW domains)
- [x] Theoretical coherence (schema-mediated consolidation framework consistent)

**Assessment:**
The concept document demonstrates excellent theoretical grounding in schema theory (Bartlett, 1932) and schema-mediated consolidation (Ghosh & Gilboa, 2014). The theoretical framework coherently links schema congruence to differential forgetting rates through consolidation mechanisms. The distinction between congruent, incongruent, and common items is well-justified with clear theoretical rationale for expected forgetting patterns.

**Strengths:**
- Strong integration of classic schema theory with modern consolidation neuroscience
- Clear operationalization of congruence categories via item codes (i1-i6)
- Explicit predictions for congruent > common > incongruent ordering by Day 6
- Appropriate acknowledgment of Von Restorff effect as competing encoding advantage for incongruent items

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Could strengthen discussion of competing predictions (encoding advantage vs consolidation disadvantage for incongruent items)

**Score Justification:**
Near-maximum score awarded for sophisticated theoretical integration. Minor deduction (-0.1) for potential elaboration of Von Restorff vs consolidation tradeoff dynamics.

#### 2. Literature Support (1.7 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Recent citations present (Ghosh & Gilboa, 2014 is seminal)
- [ ] 2020-2024 citations included (none currently)
- [x] Citation appropriateness (citations relevant to schema-congruence claims)
- [ ] Coverage completeness (missing recent empirical work on schema-forgetting trajectories)

**Assessment:**
The concept document cites foundational works appropriately (Bartlett, 1932; Ghosh & Gilboa, 2014). However, the literature review would benefit from recent empirical studies (2020-2024) on schema congruence effects on forgetting trajectories. The field has advanced significantly since 2014, with new evidence on schema-mediated consolidation, U-shaped memory functions, and neural mechanisms.

**Strengths:**
- Seminal citations appropriately chosen (Bartlett, Ghosh & Gilboa)
- Citations directly support theoretical claims made
- Clear identification of literature gap (multi-day VR forgetting with schema manipulation)

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- No 2020-2024 empirical citations
- Missing recent work on U-shaped memory function (congruent AND incongruent both > unrelated)
- Missing neural mechanisms literature (vmPFC-hippocampus interactions)

**Score Justification:**
Good foundational citations but lacking recent empirical support. Score of 1.7/2.0 reflects need for 2-3 recent high-relevance citations.

---

#### 3. Interpretation Guidelines (1.8 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Scenario coverage for significant Congruence x Time interaction
- [x] Expected effect pattern specified (d > 0.3 for Congruent vs Incongruent at Day 6)
- [ ] Null result scenario guidance (partial)
- [x] Guidelines connect results to theory

**Assessment:**
The concept document provides clear interpretation guidelines for the expected significant Congruence x Time interaction. The expected effect pattern is well-specified with quantitative thresholds (d > 0.3). Secondary hypotheses provide additional testable predictions. However, explicit guidance for null or unexpected results could be strengthened.

**Strengths:**
- Clear primary hypothesis with expected direction
- Quantitative effect size threshold specified (d > 0.3)
- Secondary hypotheses provide nuanced predictions (Von Restorff at T1, ordering by Day 6)
- Post-hoc contrast strategy well-defined (Congruent-Common, Incongruent-Common)

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- Limited guidance for null Congruence x Time interaction scenario
- No explicit discussion of what would constitute disconfirming evidence

**Score Justification:**
Strong interpretation framework with minor gap in null result guidance. Score of 1.8/2.0.

#### 4. Theoretical Implications (2.0 / 2.0)

**Criteria Checklist:**
- [x] Clear contribution stated (schema-mediated consolidation effects on forgetting trajectories)
- [x] Implications testable and falsifiable
- [x] Broader impact discussed (implications for schema-mediated memory consolidation theories)

**Assessment:**
The concept document clearly states theoretical implications for schema-mediated consolidation theories. The contribution is novel (multi-day VR forgetting with schema manipulation is understudied) and testable. The implications extend to understanding how prior knowledge structures influence memory decay, with potential clinical applications for memory interventions.

**Strengths:**
- Explicit statement of theoretical contribution (testing schema theory predictions longitudinally)
- Novel combination of VR, schema manipulation, and IRT-based trajectory modeling
- Clear connection to broader consolidation literature
- Falsifiable predictions (congruent should show slower forgetting than incongruent)

**Weaknesses / Gaps:**
- None identified

**Score Justification:**
Full marks for clear, novel, and falsifiable theoretical contribution with appropriate broader implications.

---

#### Commission Errors (Critiques of Claims Made)

**1. Oversimplification of Schema-Congruent Memory Advantage**
- **Location:** Section 2: Theoretical Background - "Schema-congruent information is better encoded and retained"
- **Claim Made:** "Schema-congruent information is better encoded and retained because it fits existing knowledge structures"
- **Scholarly Criticism:** This oversimplifies the relationship. Recent research shows schema-congruent information can suffer from "shallow encoding" and reduced item-specific processing in some contexts.
- **Counterevidence:** van Kesteren et al. (2023) found that schema congruency benefits emerge primarily through post-encoding consolidation processes, not encoding quality. Additionally, research shows schema-congruent items show "less pronounced parietal old/new effects" suggesting shallower encoding (PMC6049394).
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** Acknowledge in Section 2 that schema-congruence benefits may operate more through consolidation than encoding. This actually strengthens the hypothesis focus on forgetting trajectories (consolidation-dependent) rather than initial acquisition.

**2. Von Restorff Effect Prediction May Be Incomplete**
- **Location:** Section 3: Hypothesis - "Von Restorff effect may boost incongruent encoding (T1 performance)"
- **Claim Made:** "Incongruent items may have good initial encoding (T1) but steeper forgetting without schema support"
- **Scholarly Criticism:** The Von Restorff effect at encoding may not be sufficient to predict T1 performance. The encoding advantage for incongruent items depends on attention and elaborative processing, which varies by task demands.
- **Counterevidence:** Brod et al. (2018) found both congruent AND incongruent items showed memory advantages over unrelated items (U-shaped function), suggesting the comparison should be framed against schema-neutral (common) items rather than expecting incongruent to start highest.
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Rebuttal:** Clarify that the prediction is for incongruent items to potentially show elevated T1 performance relative to common items (due to distinctiveness), but NOT necessarily higher than congruent items. The U-shaped function supports congruent >= incongruent > common at encoding.

#### Omission Errors (Missing Context or Claims)

**1. No Discussion of Age-Related Modulation of Schema Effects**
- **Missing Content:** Concept.md doesn't acknowledge that schema reliance varies across the lifespan (20-70 age range in REMEMVR)
- **Why It Matters:** Older adults may show stronger schema-congruence effects due to compensatory reliance on prior knowledge; younger adults may show more balanced congruent/incongruent processing
- **Supporting Literature:** Ortiz-Tudela et al. (2024) found schema-driven prediction effects on episodic memory differ across the lifespan, with older adults showing "right-tilted U-shape" favoring congruent information
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Given the wide age range (20-70), how might age-related differences in schema reliance affect your congruence effects? Did you consider age as a covariate or moderator?"
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** Add to Section 7: Limitations or Analysis Approach - acknowledge age-related modulation of schema effects and consider including age as covariate in LMM models, or as exploratory moderator analysis

**2. No Mention of U-Shaped Memory Function**
- **Missing Content:** The concept doesn't explicitly reference the U-shaped relationship between congruency and memory (congruent > unrelated; incongruent > unrelated)
- **Why It Matters:** This established finding provides stronger theoretical foundation for predictions and clarifies the comparison baseline
- **Supporting Literature:** Brod et al. (2018); van Kesteren et al. (2023) both document U-shaped function with different mechanisms for congruent vs incongruent advantages
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "Are you aware of the U-shaped memory function? How does your hypothesis relate to this established finding?"
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** Add to Section 2: Theoretical Background - cite U-shaped function and clarify that schema-neutral (common) items serve as the "unrelated" comparison category, while testing whether congruent vs incongruent show differential forgetting slopes

**3. No Discussion of Practice Effects from Repeated Testing**
- **Missing Content:** Concept.md doesn't acknowledge that participants complete memory tests 4 times (T1-T4)
- **Why It Matters:** Practice effects from repeated testing could confound forgetting trajectories; familiarity improvements might differentially affect congruence categories
- **Supporting Literature:** VR memory test literature notes that "practice effects are common on traditional neuropsychological tests and can be impacted by novelty" (BMC Psychology, 2020). Repeated VR testing shows learning effects between sessions.
- **Potential Reviewer Question:** "How do you distinguish genuine schema-mediated forgetting from practice-related improvements that might differentially benefit certain item types?"
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Addition:** Add to Section 7: Limitations or Analysis Approach - discuss IRT advantage for handling practice effects (separates item difficulty from person ability across sessions) and/or consider test session controls in LMM

---

#### Alternative Theoretical Frameworks (Not Considered)

**1. Attention Allocation as Alternative Explanation**
- **Alternative Theory:** Differential attention during encoding (not schema-mediated consolidation) could explain congruence effects
- **How It Applies:** Incongruent items may capture more attention during VR exploration, leading to stronger initial encoding; congruent items may receive less elaborative processing due to familiarity
- **Key Citation:** Moscovitch et al. (2023, Perspectives on Psychological Science) - Neurocognitive model emphasizes attention allocation in schema-congruent/incongruent learning
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** Reviewers will ask whether observed forgetting differences reflect encoding attention rather than consolidation processes
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** Add to Section 2 or Limitations - acknowledge attention-based alternative but note that longitudinal forgetting SLOPES (not intercepts) test consolidation differences; equivalent Day 0 performance would help rule out pure attention explanation

**2. Processing Fluency as Alternative Mechanism**
- **Alternative Theory:** Congruent items may be processed more fluently (ease of processing) rather than better consolidated
- **How It Applies:** Fluent processing of congruent items could lead to faster recognition without deeper memory traces; this would predict equivalent forgetting but faster RT for congruent items
- **Key Citation:** N400 attenuation studies show fluency effects for schema-congruent processing (Neuropsychologia, 2021)
- **Why Concept.md Should Address It:** Processing fluency is confounded with memory strength in recognition paradigms
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Acknowledgment:** Not critical given IRT-based ability estimation rather than simple accuracy; IRT theta scores capture latent ability controlling for item properties

---

#### Known Methodological Confounds (Unaddressed)

**1. Encoding Quality Differences by Congruence**
- **Confound Description:** Items in different congruence categories may receive different encoding quality during VR experience (different attention, interaction time, elaboration)
- **How It Could Affect Results:** Observed "forgetting trajectories" might reflect encoding quality differences rather than differential consolidation
- **Literature Evidence:** van Kesteren et al. (2023) showed schema effects operate through post-encoding brain connectivity, but encoding differences can still confound interpretations
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** VR encoding involves scripted interactions; common/congruent/incongruent items may receive different processing due to their semantic properties
- **Strength:** MODERATE
- **Suggested Mitigation:** Add to Analysis Approach or Limitations - note that Day 0 (T1) performance serves as encoding quality baseline; trajectory SLOPES control for intercept differences; focus interpretation on interaction terms (differential decay) not main effects

**2. Item-Level Confounds Within Congruence Categories**
- **Confound Description:** Specific items within each congruence category may differ in memorability beyond congruence (e.g., object size, interaction complexity, semantic distinctiveness)
- **How It Could Affect Results:** Within-category variance could mask or inflate congruence effects
- **Literature Evidence:** ACM SIGGRAPH (2024) study showed object size and color affect VR spatial memory independent of semantic factors
- **Why Relevant to This RQ:** Items i1-i6 within each room have different objects; cross-room variation in item characteristics
- **Strength:** MINOR
- **Suggested Mitigation:** IRT analysis naturally handles item-level difficulty variation; item purification step (Step 2) removes extreme items; note in limitations that items were designed to be balanced but some residual variation possible

#### Scoring Summary

**Total Concerns Identified:**
- Commission Errors: 2 (0 CRITICAL, 2 MODERATE, 0 MINOR -> revised: 0 CRITICAL, 1 MODERATE, 1 MINOR)
- Omission Errors: 3 (0 CRITICAL, 3 MODERATE, 0 MINOR)
- Alternative Frameworks: 2 (0 CRITICAL, 1 MODERATE, 1 MINOR)
- Methodological Confounds: 2 (0 CRITICAL, 1 MODERATE, 1 MINOR)

**Overall Devil's Advocate Assessment:**
The concept document demonstrates strong theoretical grounding but has MODERATE gaps in acknowledging recent literature on U-shaped memory functions, age-related schema modulation, and practice effects from repeated testing. No CRITICAL concerns identified. The theoretical framework is sound and predictions are falsifiable. Key rebuttals available: (1) IRT-based analysis controls for item-level variation, (2) focus on forgetting SLOPES controls for encoding quality differences, (3) age can be included as covariate in LMM. Recommended additions strengthen rather than undermine the RQ.

### Recommendations

#### Required Changes (Must Address for Approval)

*None - Status is APPROVED*

#### Suggested Improvements (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Add Recent Literature on U-Shaped Memory Function**
   - **Location:** Section 2: Theoretical Background
   - **Current:** Cites Bartlett (1932) and Ghosh & Gilboa (2014) only
   - **Suggested:** Add Brod et al. (2018) and/or van Kesteren et al. (2023) to establish U-shaped memory function framework and clarify that common items serve as schema-neutral baseline
   - **Benefit:** Strengthens theoretical foundation with recent empirical support; anticipates reviewer familiarity with established findings

2. **Acknowledge Age-Related Modulation of Schema Effects**
   - **Location:** Section 7: Limitations (add new section) or Section 6: Analysis Approach
   - **Current:** No mention of age effects despite 20-70 age range
   - **Suggested:** Note that schema reliance may vary across lifespan; consider age as covariate in LMM or as exploratory moderator
   - **Benefit:** Addresses methodological concern proactively; opens avenue for secondary analysis

3. **Clarify Von Restorff Prediction Relative to U-Shaped Function**
   - **Location:** Section 3: Hypothesis - Secondary Hypotheses
   - **Current:** "Von Restorff effect may boost incongruent encoding (T1 performance)"
   - **Suggested:** Clarify expectation is incongruent >= common at T1 (distinctiveness advantage), while congruent >= incongruent (schema support); both may exceed common baseline
   - **Benefit:** More precise prediction aligned with established U-shaped function literature

4. **Add Note on Practice Effects and IRT Mitigation**
   - **Location:** Section 6: Analysis Approach - Special Methods
   - **Current:** No mention of repeated testing confounds
   - **Suggested:** Add sentence noting that IRT-based ability estimation separates person ability from item/session characteristics, providing natural control for practice effects across T1-T4
