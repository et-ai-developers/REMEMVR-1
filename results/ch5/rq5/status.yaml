    RQ 5.5: Schema congruence effects on forgetting trajectories
    Factors: Common/Congruent/Incongruent (NOT WWW domains)
    Analysis: IRT (2-pass GRM) + LMM (5 candidate models)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.1 (step00_irt_input.csv, step00_tsvr_mapping.csv)
    Critical: Congruence coded by item suffix (i1-i2=common, i3-i4=congruent, i5-i6=incongruent)

    5.5 validated: 9.4/10 APPROVED. Theory excellent, needs 2-3 recent citations.
    0 critical issues, 5 moderate suggestions for U-shaped function, age modulation, practice effects.
    Literature: 14 papers reviewed, 6 high-relevance. Key additions: Gilboa & Marlatte 2017, Brod 2018.
    Next: rq_stats for statistical validation.

    9.4/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 2.8/3 (IRT+LMM appropriate). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% tool reuse). Cat3: 1.9/2 (Bonferroni calc unclear). Cat4: 1.8/2 (no convergence contingency). Cat5: 0.9/1 (7 concerns, well-cited). Schema congruence methodology sound. Next: rq_planner.

    8 analysis steps planned (Step 00-07): extraction, IRT Pass1, purification, IRT Pass2, TSVR merge, LMM, post-hoc, plot data.
    IRT: 3-dim GRM (common/congruent/incongruent), Treatment coding (common=reference). Cross-RQ: uses RQ 5.1 step00 outputs.
    LMM: 5 candidate models, Congruence x Time interaction tests. D039/D068/D069/D070 applied. Validation at every step.

    Validated all 8 analysis steps for RQ 5.5 (schema congruence).
    IRT: 72 items -> 51 purified (70.8%), 3-dim GRM converged, theta in [-2.07, 2.72].
    LMM: Log model best (AIC=2652.57), no significant Congruence x Time interactions (all p > 0.14).
    Post-hoc: 3 contrasts computed with Bonferroni correction, 5 effect sizes (1 small, 4 negligible).
    Outputs: 8 data files, 4 results files, 2 plot data files. All pass 4-layer validation.
