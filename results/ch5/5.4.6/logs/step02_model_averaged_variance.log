[2025-12-09 14:25:40]   TSVR: TSVR_hours
[2025-12-09 14:25:40]   Groups: UID (N=100)
[2025-12-09 14:25:40]   Stratify by: congruence
[2025-12-09 14:25:40]   Stratify levels: ['common', 'congruent', 'incongruent']
[2025-12-09 14:25:40]   N observations: 1200
[2025-12-09 14:25:40]   Random effects: intercept=True, slope=True
[2025-12-09 14:25:40] 
[STEP 2] Running kitchen sink model comparison (unstratified)...
[2025-12-09 14:25:40]   This identifies competitive functional forms across ALL data
[2025-12-09 14:25:40]   (not stratified by congruence/domain - form is global property)
[2025-12-09 14:25:40]   Random effects formula: ~TSVR_hours
[2025-12-09 14:26:41]   ✓ Kitchen sink complete: 65 models converged
[2025-12-09 14:26:41]   Best model: PowerLaw_01 (weight=6.1%)
[2025-12-09 14:26:41]

[2025-12-09 14:26:41]   Competitive models: 20
[2025-12-09 14:26:41]   Cumulative weight: 67.1%
[2025-12-09 14:26:41]   Capping at 6 models (computational cost control)
[2025-12-09 14:26:41]   Adjusted cumulative weight: 32.5%
[2025-12-09 14:26:41]   Models to average: ['PowerLaw_01', 'Log', 'Log10', 'Log2', 'PowerLaw_02', 'SquareRoot']
[2025-12-09 14:26:41]
