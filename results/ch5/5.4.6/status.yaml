    RQ 5.4.6: Schema-Specific Variance Decomposition
    Type: Congruence / Variance decomposition by schema
    Analysis: LMM stratified by congruence, ICC computation
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.1 theta scores (1200 obs)
    Critical: 3 congruence levels, ICC > 0.40 threshold

    9.4/10.0 APPROVED (RE-VALIDATED 2025-12-02). Critical practice effects omission now resolved via explicit Consideration section. Upgraded from 9.1 CONDITIONAL. Scores improved: Theoretical Grounding 2.8→2.9, Literature Support 1.7→1.8, Theoretical Implications 1.8→1.9. Ready for rq_planner. Optional: ceiling effects parallel section for 9.5+ quality.

    9.7/10.0 APPROVED (RE-VALIDATED 2025-12-02 after concept update). Cat1: 3.0/3.0 (convergence strategy complete). Cat2: 2.0/2.0 (100% tool reuse, 9 tools). Cat3: 1.8/2.0 (parameters adequate, Breusch-Pagan ambiguity minor). Cat4: 2.0/2.0 (comprehensive validation: convergence contingency + homoscedasticity Levene/BP + independence ACF + practice effects). Cat5: 0.9/1.0 (7 concerns, critical omissions RESOLVED). All required changes addressed: (1) LRT-based convergence fallback documented, (2) Homoscedasticity testing procedure complete. Report: results/ch5/5.4.6/docs/1_stats.md
