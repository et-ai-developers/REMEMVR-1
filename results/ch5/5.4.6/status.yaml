    RQ 5.4.6: Schema-Specific Variance Decomposition
    Type: Congruence / Variance decomposition by schema
    Analysis: LMM stratified by congruence, ICC computation
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.1 theta scores (1200 obs)
    Critical: 3 congruence levels, ICC > 0.40 threshold

    9.4/10.0 APPROVED (RE-VALIDATED 2025-12-02). Critical practice effects omission now resolved via explicit Consideration section. Upgraded from 9.1 CONDITIONAL. Scores improved: Theoretical Grounding 2.8→2.9, Literature Support 1.7→1.8, Theoretical Implications 1.8→1.9. Ready for rq_planner. Optional: ceiling effects parallel section for 9.5+ quality.

    9.7/10.0 APPROVED (RE-VALIDATED 2025-12-02 after concept update). Cat1: 3.0/3.0 (convergence strategy complete). Cat2: 2.0/2.0 (100% tool reuse, 9 tools). Cat3: 1.8/2.0 (parameters adequate, Breusch-Pagan ambiguity minor). Cat4: 2.0/2.0 (comprehensive validation: convergence contingency + homoscedasticity Levene/BP + independence ACF + practice effects). Cat5: 0.9/1.0 (7 concerns, critical omissions RESOLVED). All required changes addressed: (1) LRT-based convergence fallback documented, (2) Homoscedasticity testing procedure complete. Report: results/ch5/5.4.6/docs/1_stats.md

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    6 steps planned (no Step 0 - DERIVED data from RQ 5.4.1).
    Tool requirements: LMM fitting (stratified by congruence), ICC computation, random effects extraction, correlation tests (D068), diagnostic plots.
    Expected outputs: 7 data files (variance components, ICC estimates, random effects, correlations, comparison), 7 PNG plots (6 diagnostics + 1 comparison).

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    5 analysis + 6 validation tools cataloged for LMM-stratified variance decomposition.
    Analysis tools: fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr (stratified), compute_icc_from_variance_components, extract_random_effects_from_lmm, test_intercept_slope_correlation_d068, plot_histogram_by_group.
    Validation tools: validate_lmm_convergence, validate_variance_positivity, validate_icc_bounds, validate_dataframe_structure, validate_correlation_test_d068, check_file_exists.
    Decision D068 embedded: Dual p-value reporting for intercept-slope correlations (uncorrected + Bonferroni).
    Decision D070 inherited: TSVR_hours as time variable from RQ 5.4.1.

rq_analysis:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9 step specifications created (6 main + 3 sub-steps for validation/plotting).
    Type: LMM-stratified variance decomposition (no IRT - uses RQ 5.4.1 theta).
    Step 1: Load dependency (stdlib). Step 2: Fit LMMs (catalogued). Step 3: Compute ICC (catalogued).
    Step 4: Extract random effects (catalogued). Step 5: Test correlations + plots (catalogued + stdlib).
    Step 6: Compare ICC across congruence (stdlib). All steps have validation tools (100% coverage).

rq_inspect:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    Validated 6 analysis steps for RQ 5.4.6 (variance decomposition)
    Layer 1-4 PASS: All files exist, structure correct, values reasonable, logs clean
    Key outputs: 15 variance components, 9 ICC estimates, 300 random effects, 3 correlations (D068), 7 plots
    Notable: Congruent model non-convergence documented (acceptable per plan contingency), TSVR [1, 246] expected per user note

    8 plots generated from MODEL-AVERAGED data (6 competitive models)
    Plots: 3 histograms + 3 Q-Q plots (random slopes) + 1 ICC barplot + 1 model weights barplot
    KEY: Model averaging reveals NON-ZERO slope variance (ICC_slope=0.036-0.148)
    CONTEXT: Log-only underestimated slope variance by 85-95% (showed spike at zero)

    Results validated for model-averaged scientific plausibility (6 competitive models)
    KEY FINDING: Forgetting rate PARTIALLY trait-like (ICC_slope=0.036-0.148), NOT purely situation-dependent
    Hypothesis: PARTIALLY REJECTED (ICC < 0.40 but non-negligible). Common>Congruent>Incongruent (OPPOSITE to prediction)
    METHODOLOGICAL: Log-only underestimated slope variance 85-95%. Model averaging MANDATORY when best model weight < 30%
