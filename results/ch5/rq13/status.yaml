    RQ 5.13: Between-Person Variance in Forgetting Rates
    Domains: What/Where/When (All - single factor from RQ 5.7)
    Analysis: Variance decomposition of LMM random effects (ICC computation)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.7 (saved LMM model + theta scores + TSVR)
    Critical: Requires RQ 5.7 complete, extracts variance components and individual random slopes for RQ 5.14

    5.13 validated: 9.3/10 APPROVED. Strong theory, adequate literature (missing Sense 2016), excellent interpretation. 3 CRITICAL concerns (practice effects, encoding vs forgetting, test-retest carryover) all have reasonable rebuttals. 5 optional improvements suggested.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: "9.5/10 APPROVED. Category 1: 3.0/3 (optimal variance decomposition, REML for N=100, dual ICC methods). Category 2: 1.7/2 (75% tool reuse, missing ICC + normality tools). Category 3: 2.0/2 (parameters well-specified, Bonferroni overcorrection noted). Category 4: 2.0/2 (normality check + DERIVED convergence). Category 5: 0.8/1 (9 concerns, all cited, moderate thoroughness)."

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    5 analysis steps planned (Step 0: load RQ 5.7 model + Steps 1-4: variance extraction/ICC/correlation/plots)
    Tool requirements: variance extraction, ICC computation, correlation test (D068), plotting (histogram + Q-Q)
    Expected outputs: 7 files (variance components, ICC, random effects, correlation, descriptives, 2 plots)
    Validation required at every step. Cross-RQ dependency: RQ 5.7 must be complete (saved LMM with random slopes)
