    Analysis plan created: 5 steps planned (Step 1: load RQ 5.7 dependencies, Steps 2-5: variance decomposition/ICC/random effects/correlation test).
    Tool requirements: LMM variance extraction, ICC computation, correlation test with D068 dual p-values, visualization (histogram + Q-Q plot).
    Expected outputs: 8 data files (variance components, ICCs, random effects for RQ 5.14), 4 result files (summaries, correlation test), 2 plots (histogram, Q-Q). Validation required at every step.
