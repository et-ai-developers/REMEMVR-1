    Domains: All three WWW (inherited from RQ 5.1.1, collapsed across domains)

    Analysis: LMM (3 convergent tests - quadratic term, piecewise vs continuous AIC,
    slope ratio)

    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.1.1 (theta scores, TSVR mapping, best continuous model)

    Critical: Tests consolidation theory inflection at Day 1 (48h TSVR). Requires
    RQ 5.1.1 complete.

    Analysis plan created: 7 steps planned (Step 0: data loading + Steps 1-6: analysis and visualization).
    Tool requirements: LMM trajectory modeling (quadratic, piecewise), comprehensive assumption validation, slope extraction, plot data preparation.
    Expected outputs: 10+ files (2 model summaries, predictions CSVs, assumption validation report, slope comparison, plot source CSV).
    Cross-RQ dependency: RQ 5.7 (theta scores, TSVR mapping, best continuous model).
    Validation required at every step (6 analysis steps, all with 4-layer substance criteria).

    ALL 7 STEPS SUCCESSFUL (after tool bug fixes).
    Generated code for steps 00-06. g_code bugs fixed: 3 (Step 0 file refs, Steps 2-3 API mismatch, Step 3 DataFrame.data).
    Tool bugs fixed: 2 (Step 4 validate_lmm_assumptions_comprehensive.get_influence()->studentized_residuals, Step 5 extract_segment_slopes coefficient auto-detection).
    ALL outputs generated: theta+TSVR (400 rows), quadratic model (AIC=940.32), piecewise model (AIC=878.74), assumption validation (6 diagnostics), slope comparison (ratio=0.161), plot source (33 rows).
    NUANCED FINDING: deltaAIC=+5.03 favors CONTINUOUS model (gradual transition), BUT slope ratio=0.161<0.5 confirms ROBUST two-phase pattern (interaction p<0.0001). Resolution: Forgetting DOES decelerate over time, but GRADUALLY not as sharp inflection at 48h.

    Validated all 7 steps (Step 00-06) - ALL PASS (4-layer validation)
    Step 2 fix confirmed: No CI_lower==CI_upper issues, model converged with (1|UID) fallback, AIC=873.24
    Step 5 fix confirmed: All 4 metrics present (Early_slope, Late_slope, Ratio, Interaction_p)
    Key findings: Quadratic significant (p<0.0033), deltaAIC=+5.03 favors continuous, ratio=0.161<0.5 robust two-phase
    Outputs verified: 400 rows theta+TSVR, 11 quadratic predictions, 18 piecewise predictions, 33 plot data rows
