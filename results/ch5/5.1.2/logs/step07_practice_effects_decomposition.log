[STEP 1] Loading data and defining practice vs forgetting phases...
  Loaded: 400 observations, 100 participants
  Practice phase: 200 observations (T1→T2)
  Forgetting phase: 200 observations (T2→T4)

[STEP 2] Fitting dual-phase model: theta ~ Time_within_phase * Phase...
  This tests if Practice phase slope differs from Forgetting phase slope

  Converged: True
  AIC: 869.86

[STEP 3] Extracting practice vs forgetting slopes...
  Practice phase (T1→T2) slope:
    β = -0.003325 ± 0.001031
    p = 0.001258
  Forgetting phase (T2→T4) slope:
    β = -0.018965 ± 0.003094
  Interaction p-value: 0.000000

[STEP 4] Testing for practice effect...
  Slope difference (Practice - Forgetting):
    Δβ = 0.015640 ± 0.003261
    z = 4.796
    p = 0.000002

  SIGNIFICANT practice effect detected (p < 0.0033)
  INTERPRETATION: Practice PARTIALLY masks forgetting
                  (T1→T2 decline less steep than T2→T4)

[STEP 5] Comparing practice decomposition to original piecewise model...
  Original piecewise model:
    - Inflection at 48 hours (arbitrary time-based cutoff)
    - Early/Late segments may mix practice and forgetting

  Practice decomposition model:
    - Inflection at T2 (first retest, ~24h)
    - Phase 1 (T1→T2): Practice + forgetting confounded
    - Phase 2 (T2→T4): Pure forgetting (practice saturated)

  CONCLUSION: Practice effects significant
              Original piecewise model may conflate practice with consolidation
              Two-phase pattern could reflect:
                1. Consolidation (biological stabilization)
                2. Practice saturation (retrieval strengthening)
                3. Both processes operating simultaneously

[STEP 6] Saving practice decomposition results...

KEY FINDINGS:
  1. Practice slope: β = -0.003325 (p = 0.001258)
  2. Forgetting slope: β = -0.018965
  3. Difference: Δβ = 0.015640 (p = 0.000002)

NEXT STEPS:
  1. Apply this methodology to RQ 5.1.3 (test Age × Phase interaction)
  2. Update RQ 5.1.2 summary.md with practice effect findings
  3. Revise two-phase interpretation (consolidation vs practice saturation)
