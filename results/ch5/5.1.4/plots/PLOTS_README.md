## Diagnostic Plots (Step 5 - Pre-existing)

### 1. step05_random_slopes_histogram.png
- **Purpose:** Distribution of random slopes from original Lin+Log model
- **Generated by:** code/step05_test_correlation.py during Step 5 analysis
- **Shows:** Histogram with normal overlay, assessing normality assumption
- **Status:** Pre-existing, no regeneration needed

### 2. step05_random_slopes_qqplot.png
- **Purpose:** Q-Q plot for normality assessment
- **Generated by:** code/step05_test_correlation.py during Step 5 analysis
- **Shows:** Quantile-quantile plot comparing observed vs theoretical normal distribution
- **Status:** Pre-existing, no regeneration needed

## Model-Averaged Comparison Plots (Step 6 - NEW)

### 3. model_comparison.png
- **Purpose:** Compare AIC values across 65 models tested
- **Data source:** data/step06_model_comparison.csv
- **Shows:** 
  - Top 20 models by ΔAIC
  - Green bars: ΔAIC < 2.0 (competitive models)
  - Red bars: ΔAIC ≥ 2.0 (less competitive)
  - Threshold line at ΔAIC = 2.0
  - Annotation: 19 competitive models identified
- **Key finding:** Power law variants dominate top positions

### 4. icc_comparison.png
- **Purpose:** Compare original (Lin+Log) vs model-averaged ICCs
- **Data sources:** 
  - data/step03_icc_estimates.csv (original)
  - data/step06_averaged_iccs.csv (model-averaged)
- **Shows:**
  - Grouped bar chart for 3 ICC types
  - Blue bars: Original Lin+Log model
  - Red bars: Model-averaged (10 power law models)
  - Threshold line at ICC = 0.40 (substantial variance threshold)
- **Key finding:** 
  - ICC_slope increased from 0.05% → 21.6% (430x improvement)
  - ICC_slope_conditional increased from 60.6% → 92.5%

### 5. random_effects_distribution.png
- **Purpose:** Distribution of model-averaged random slopes
- **Data source:** data/step06_averaged_random_effects.csv (100 participants)
- **Shows:**
  - Histogram (bins=25) with KDE overlay
  - Mean reference line
  - Descriptive statistics box (mean, SD, range)
- **Key finding:** Model-averaged slopes show clear individual differences

### 6. variance_comparison.png
- **Purpose:** Compare original vs model-averaged variance components
- **Data sources:**
  - data/step02_variance_components.csv (original)
  - data/step06_averaged_variance_components.csv (model-averaged)
- **Shows:**
  - Grouped bars for 3 variance components
  - Blue bars: Original Lin+Log model
  - Red bars: Model-averaged
  - Annotation: var_slope increased 625x
- **Key finding:** 
  - var_slope: 0.000157 → 0.098 (625x increase)
  - Suggests original Lin+Log model severely underestimated individual differences

## Key Insights from Model-Averaged Results

1. **Model Selection Matters:** Original Lin+Log model was 10th best by AIC, not optimal
2. **Power Law Superiority:** Top 5 models all power law variants (α = 0.3-0.7)
3. **Variance Underestimation:** Original model underestimated slope variance by 625x
4. **ICC Improvement:** Model averaging reveals substantial individual differences (21.6% vs 0.05%)
5. **Hypothesis Reconsideration:** With model-averaged ICC_slope = 21.6%, result moves closer to "moderate individual differences" interpretation (though still < 40% "substantial" threshold)
