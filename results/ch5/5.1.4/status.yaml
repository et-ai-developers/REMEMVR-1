    Analysis plan created: 5 steps planned (Step 1: load RQ 5.1.1 dependencies, Steps 2-5: variance decomposition/ICC/random effects/correlation test).
    Tool requirements: LMM variance extraction, ICC computation, correlation test with D068 dual p-values, visualization (histogram + Q-Q plot).
    Expected outputs: 8 data files (variance components, ICCs, random effects for RQ 5.1.5), 4 result files (summaries, correlation test), 2 plots (histogram, Q-Q). Validation required at every step.

    Validated all 5 analysis steps for RQ 5.1.4 (re-run with Lin+Log model)
    Model: Lin+Log from RQ 5.1.1, 100 participants, 400 observations, converged=True
    Variance: var_slope=0.000157 (vs Log model ≈0), ICC_slope_simple=0.05% (improved from 0%)
    Key results: ICC_intercept=0.606, ICC_slope_simple=0.05%, r(intercept-slope)=-0.973 (p<0.001)

    MODEL-AVERAGED UPGRADE (GOLD STATUS): Tested 65 models, 10 competitive power law variants
    FINDING REVERSED: ICC_slope 0.05% (Lin+Log) -> 21.6% (model-averaged), 432× increase
    Forgetting IS trait-like (moderate range 20-40%), not noise as single-model suggested
    Summary documents model-averaged variance decomposition, power law dominance, methodological lesson
