INTERCEPT-SLOPE CORRELATION TEST RESULTS (RQ 5.13 Step 5)
================================================================================

Correlation: r = -0.9727
Direction: Negative
Magnitude: Strong negative correlation (r=-0.973) between random intercepts and slopes. Significant after Bonferroni correction (p=0.0000 < 0.05).

SIGNIFICANCE TESTS (Decision D068 Dual P-Value Reporting)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uncorrected p-value: p = 0.000000
  Significant at alpha=0.05? YES

Bonferroni-corrected p-value: p = 0.000000
  Family size: 15 tests (Chapter 5)
  Corrected alpha: 0.05/15 = 0.0033
  Significant at corrected alpha? YES

INTERPRETATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Negative correlation suggests that participants with higher baseline
memory (positive random intercepts) tend to have slower forgetting rates
(negative random slopes, meaning less steep decline).

The correlation is statistically significant even after Bonferroni
correction, indicating a robust relationship between baseline ability
and forgetting rate that is unlikely due to chance.
