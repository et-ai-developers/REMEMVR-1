RQ 5.13: Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) Estimates
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
Quantify proportion of variance in forgetting trajectories that reflects
stable individual differences (between-person variance) vs measurement
noise or within-person fluctuation (residual variance).

METHODOLOGY:
ICC = Between-person variance / (Between-person + Within-person variance)

INTERPRETATION THRESHOLDS:
  - ICC < 0.20: Low (forgetting rate mostly noise)
  - 0.20 <= ICC < 0.40: Moderate (mixed trait/state)
  - ICC >= 0.40: Substantial (forgetting rate is trait-like)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESULTS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTERCEPT:
  ICC = 0.606
  Interpretation: High clustering (0.30-0.75)
  Implication: 60.6% of variance in baseline memory ability
                reflects stable individual differences (trait-like)

SLOPE_CONDITIONAL:
  ICC = 0.606
  Interpretation: High clustering (0.30-0.75)
  Implication: 60.6% of variance in forgetting rate
                reflects stable individual differences (trait-like)

SLOPE_SIMPLE:
  ICC = 0.001
  Interpretation: Low clustering (<0.10)
  Implication: 0.1% of variance in forgetting rate
                reflects stable individual differences (trait-like)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HYPOTHESIS EVALUATION:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HYPOTHESIS SUPPORTED: ICC_slope = 0.606 >= 0.40
Forgetting rates reflect substantial stable individual differences
(trait-like property, not just measurement noise).
