EFFECT SIZE SUMMARY - Age Impact on Day 6 Memory (RQ 5.9)
======================================================================

SCENARIOS COMPARED:
  1. Average age: 44.6 years (Age_c = 0.00)
  2. Older adults: 59.1 years (Age_c = 14.52)

  Age difference: +1 SD = 14.52 years

PREDICTED THETA SCORES AT DAY 6 (TSVR = 144 hours):
  Average age:  -0.478
  Older adults: -0.576

AGE DECLINE AT DAY 6:
  Absolute decline: -0.099 theta units
  Percentage decline: 20.6%

INTERPRETATION:
  Older adults (+ 1 SD age) show lower memory retention
  at Day 6 compared to average-age participants. A 0.099 theta
  unit decline represents a 20.6% reduction in memory ability
  after ~6 days of retention.

NOTE:
  - Theta scores are on IRT scale (mean 0, SD 1 in calibration sample)
  - Negative decline indicates worse memory for older adults (expected)
  - Positive decline would indicate better memory for older adults (unexpected)
  - Effect size quantifies practical significance of age effects on forgetting
