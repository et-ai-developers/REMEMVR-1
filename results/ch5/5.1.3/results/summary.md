## 1. Statistical Findings

### Sample Characteristics

**Participants:**
- Total N: 100 participants (400 observations across 4 test sessions)
- Age range: 20.0 to 70.0 years (M = 44.57, SD = 14.52)
- Age distribution: Young tertile (20-38 yrs, N=33), Middle tertile (38-55 yrs, N=34), Older tertile (55-70 yrs, N=33)
- Missing data: 0% (complete Age data for all participants)
- Data source: DERIVED from RQ 5.7 theta scores (composite "All" domains) merged with Age from dfData.csv

**Measurements:**
- Dependent variable: Theta scores (IRT-calibrated episodic memory ability, range: -2.52 to 2.73)
- Time variable: TSVR (actual hours since VR encoding, range: 1.0 to 246.2 hours)
- Predictor: Age_c (grand-mean centered age, M = 0.00, SD = 14.52)

### Linear Mixed Model Results

**Model Specification:**
- Formula: `theta ~ (Time + Time_log) * Age_c + (Time | UID)`
- Functional form: Lin+Log (inherited from RQ 5.7 best model)
- Random effects: Random intercepts and linear time slopes by participant
- Estimation: Maximum Likelihood (REML=False)
- Convergence: Successful

**Fixed Effect Estimates:**

| Effect | � | SE | z | p (uncorr) | p (Bonf) | Interpretation |
|--------|------|------|------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Intercept | 0.807 | 0.096 | 8.39 | <.001 | <.001 | Baseline memory for average-aged adult (44.6 yrs) at encoding |
| Time (linear) | -0.002 | 0.001 | -2.14 | .033 | .098 | Linear forgetting component (significant uncorrected) |
| Time_log | -0.198 | 0.034 | -5.84 | <.001 | <.001 | Logarithmic forgetting component (rapid early decline) |
| **Age_c** | **-0.012** | **0.007** | **-1.88** | **.061** | **.182** | **Age effect on baseline memory (marginal, n.s.)** |
| **Time:Age_c** | **0.000** | **0.000** | **0.21** | **.831** | **1.000** | **Age effect on linear forgetting (n.s., wrong direction)** |
| **Time_log:Age_c** | **0.001** | **0.002** | **0.30** | **.761** | **1.000** | **Age effect on log forgetting (n.s., wrong direction)** |

**Bonferroni Correction:** � = 0.0167 for 3 age-related tests (intercept + 2 slope interactions)

**Variance Components:**
- Random intercept variance: 0.664 (substantial individual differences in baseline ability)
- Random slope variance: 0.000009 (minimal individual differences in linear forgetting rate)
- Residual variance: 0.223

### Hypothesis Testing Summary

**Hypothesis 1 (Baseline Memory):** Age negatively predicts intercept
- **Result:** � = -0.012, p = 0.061 (uncorrected), p = 0.182 (Bonferroni)
- **Status:** **NOT SUPPORTED** - Effect in predicted direction but non-significant
- **Interpretation:** 1 SD increase in age (~14.5 years) predicts 0.012 lower theta at baseline (trivial effect size)

**Hypothesis 2 (Linear Forgetting Rate):** Age negatively predicts Time slope
- **Result:** � = 0.000015, p = 0.831
- **Status:** **NOT SUPPORTED** - Near-zero effect, wrong direction (positive)
- **Interpretation:** No evidence age affects constant-rate forgetting component

**Hypothesis 3 (Logarithmic Forgetting Rate):** Age negatively predicts Time_log slope
- **Result:** � = 0.001, p = 0.761
- **Status:** **NOT SUPPORTED** - Near-zero effect, wrong direction (positive)
- **Interpretation:** No evidence age affects early rapid forgetting component

### Effect Size Analysis (Day 6 Memory)

**Comparison Scenarios:**
- **Average age (44.6 years):** Predicted theta at Day 6 = -0.478
- **Age + 1 SD (59.1 years):** Predicted theta at Day 6 = -0.576

**Age-related decline:**
- Absolute decline: 0.098 theta units (1 SD age increase � 0.10 lower theta)
- Percentage decline: 20.6% relative to average-aged adult at Day 6
- Cohen's d-equivalent: 0.10 (trivial effect size on theta scale)

**Cross-Reference to plan.md:**
- Expected effect size: d ~ 0.2-0.5 (small-medium)
- Observed effect size: d ~ 0.10 (below expected range)
- Conclusion: Age effects substantially weaker than literature-based predictions

## 2. Plot Descriptions

### Figure 1: Age Tertile Trajectories with LMM Predictions

**Filename:** `plots/age_tertile_trajectory.png`
**Plot Type:** Scatter plot with individual observations (colored dots) and LMM trajectory predictions (dashed lines)
**Generated By:** Step 5 plot data preparation + rq_plots plotting

**Visual Description:**

The plot displays episodic memory trajectories (theta scores) across the full retention interval (0-250 hours TSVR) for three age tertiles:

- **X-axis:** Hours Since VR Encoding (TSVR): 0 to 250 hours
- **Y-axis:** Memory Ability (Theta): -2.5 to 2.5
- **Color coding:**
  - Green: Young tertile (20-38 years, N=33)
  - Orange: Middle tertile (38-55 years, N=34)
  - Red: Older tertile (55-70 years, N=33)
- **Markers:** Solid circles = observed individual data points
- **Lines:** Dashed lines = LMM predictions for each tertile

**Key Visual Patterns:**

1. **High scatter:** Substantial individual variability within each age tertile at all timepoints (theta range spans ~4 units within each tertile)
2. **Overlapping tertiles:** No clear visual separation between age groups - all three colors intermingle throughout the retention interval
3. **General decline:** All tertiles show downward trend from encoding (0 hours) to Day 6+ (144-250 hours), consistent with forgetting
4. **Minimal age-graded ordering:** Unlike domain-based RQ 5.1 (where What/Where/When showed clear separation), age tertiles do not show systematic ranking
5. **Sparse data at extremes:** Few observations beyond 170 hours (one participant at 244 hours)

**LMM Prediction Patterns (Dashed Lines):**

- **Young (green dashed):** Starts at � H 1.0, declines to � H 0.0 by 100 hours, then shows **slight upturn** to � H 0.3 by 250 hours (counterintuitive)
- **Middle (orange dashed):** Starts at � H 0.5, shows **extreme dip** to � H -2.3 around 150-200 hours (implausible), then recovers
- **Older (red dashed):** Starts at � H 0.5, shows steady decline to � H -1.0 by 250 hours (most monotonic pattern)

**Anomalous Features:**
- Young trajectory upturn after 100 hours contradicts forgetting theory (no mechanism for memory improvement without retrieval practice)
- Middle trajectory extreme dip (-2.3 theta) far exceeds observed data scatter (no individual data points below -2.0 in that timeframe)
- Prediction instability suggests overfitting or interaction term issues (Age_c � Time interactions near-zero but producing erratic tertile-level predictions)

**Connection to Statistical Findings:**

- **Visual overlap � Non-significant age effects:** The lack of clear tertile separation directly supports statistical finding that age effects on forgetting are negligible (� H 0.0001-0.001, p > 0.76)
- **High scatter � Large residual variance:** Individual differences dominate age-related variance (residual ò = 0.223 vs. tiny age interaction coefficients)
- **Implausible LMM predictions � Model diagnostics:** Visual anomalies (upturn, extreme dip) align with autocorrelation violation flagged in validation (Lag-1 ACF = -0.237)
- **Error bars absent:** Plot shows raw individual observations rather than aggregated means, making visual assessment of age differences challenging (future plots should aggregate by tertile � timepoint bins with 95% CIs)

**Interpretation:**
Visual inspection corroborates statistical conclusion: age effects on memory trajectories are minimal in this healthy adult sample (ages 20-70). If dual deficit hypothesis held, we would expect clear vertical separation with Older < Middle < Young at all timepoints, which is not observed.

## 3. Interpretation

### Hypothesis Testing

**Original Hypothesis (from 1_concept.md):**
"Age will negatively predict both intercept (baseline memory at Day 0) and slope (forgetting rate across 6 days), consistent with hippocampal aging effects."

**Hypothesis Status:** **NOT SUPPORTED**

All three age-related hypotheses failed to reach significance after Bonferroni correction:

1. **H1 (Baseline memory):** � = -0.012, p = 0.182 - marginal effect in predicted direction but non-significant
2. **H2 (Linear forgetting):** � = 0.000015, p = 1.000 - near-zero effect, wrong direction
3. **H3 (Logarithmic forgetting):** � = 0.001, p = 1.000 - near-zero effect, wrong direction

**Critical finding:** Age effects on forgetting rate (slopes) are not merely non-significant - they are in the OPPOSITE direction predicted by dual deficit hypothesis (positive coefficients suggest older adults forget SLOWER, contradicting hippocampal aging literature).

### Theoretical Contextualization

**Dual Deficit Hypothesis (Nyberg et al., 2012):**

The dual deficit hypothesis predicts older adults exhibit: (1) lower baseline encoding ability, and (2) faster forgetting due to impaired consolidation/retrieval. This RQ's findings challenge both predictions:

- **Encoding deficit:** Marginal evidence (� = -0.012, p = 0.061 uncorrected) suggests a weak baseline disadvantage for older adults, but effect size is trivial (0.012 theta per 14.5-year age increase H 0.00083 theta/year)
- **Consolidation/retrieval deficit:** No evidence - Age � Time interactions near-zero and positive (opposite predicted direction)

**Hippocampal Aging Hypothesis (Raz et al., 2005):**

Hippocampal volume declines ~1% per year after age 60, predicting age-related memory deficits. However, our sample's age range (20-70) may not capture the accelerated decline period:

- Online Cognitive Test 40,000+ participants (2022): Segmented regression revealed shift from gradual to rapid episodic memory decline in **early 60s**
- Our sample: Only 7 participants e65 years (oldest = 70), limiting variance in the rapid-decline range
- Implication: Age effects may be non-linear (minimal 20-60, steep 60+), which linear/log interaction terms cannot capture

**VR Encoding Contextual Support Hypothesis (Novel):**

An alternative interpretation: Immersive VR provides rich spatial/temporal context cues that scaffold memory consolidation across age groups, reducing age-related forgetting differences:

- VR desktop paradigm (REMEMVR) offers 3D navigation, landmark-rich environment, active exploration
- Contextual cues may compensate for hippocampal aging by providing retrieval supports unavailable in traditional word-list or 2D paradigms
- Prediction: Age effects on forgetting may emerge more strongly in decontextualized tasks (e.g., paired-associate learning) vs. VR spatial navigation

**Literature Connections (from rq_scholar validation):**

- **Raz et al. (2005):** Meta-analysis of hippocampal aging - but volumetric decline ` automatic functional decline for cognitively healthy adults
- **Nyberg et al. (2012):** Longitudinal dual deficit study - but used verbal memory (words), not VR spatial/episodic tasks
- **Scientific Reports (2024):** Encoding quality alternative - forgetting rates comparable when initial encoding equated. Our findings may support this: if VR provides equivalent encoding quality across ages (via contextual richness), forgetting rates should not differ.

### Unexpected Patterns

**1. Wrong-Direction Age Effects on Forgetting (CRITICAL ANOMALY):**

**Observation:** Both Age � Time interactions are POSITIVE (� = 0.000015 and 0.001), suggesting older adults forget SLOWER than younger adults.

**Why unexpected:** Contradicts 40+ years of aging literature showing accelerated forgetting in older adults (e.g., Craik & Rose, 2012; Uttl & Graf, 1993)

**Possible Explanations:**

**(a) Practice Effects Confound (Most Likely):**
- Participants complete identical VR test 4 times (Days 0, 1, 3, 6)
- Practice benefits documented in longitudinal memory studies (mean retest effect ~0.60 SD, BMC Neuroscience 2010)
- If younger adults benefit MORE from practice (steeper learning curves), their trajectories would show attenuated decline or even improvement, creating spurious "faster forgetting" appearance relative to older adults
- Older adults' smaller practice benefits � more genuine forgetting visible � appears as "slower forgetting" when compared to practice-inflated younger trajectories
- **Test:** Age � Session interaction in practice effect literature (need to examine whether younger adults show larger retest gains)

**(b) Sample Selection Bias:**
- Sample restricted to cognitively healthy community-dwelling adults (no dementia, MCI)
- Recruitment stratified by age but excluded impaired individuals
- Older participants (50-70) may be "super-agers" (above-average cognitive function for their age)
- Younger participants (20-30) include full ability range (no selection for high function)
- **Result:** Older subsample may have comparable or superior memory strategies/motivation relative to unselected younger subsample

**(c) Null Effect (True Absence of Age Differences):**
- Effect sizes near-zero (� = 0.0001-0.001) with tight standard errors (SE = 0.0001-0.002)
- Not merely underpowered (N=400 observations, 100 participants) - coefficients are trivially small
- VR paradigm may genuinely equalize forgetting rates through contextual support (hypothesis above)
- Age affects encoding (marginal baseline deficit) but not consolidation/retrieval in this task

**(d) Measurement Artifact (IRT Theta Scaling):**
- Theta scores are latent ability estimates, not raw performance
- IRT scoring accounts for item difficulty, potentially removing some age-related variance
- If older adults fail harder items (higher difficulty b parameters) but at same rate as younger adults, theta trajectories could appear parallel despite different raw accuracy declines
- **Check:** Compare raw accuracy trajectories to theta trajectories by age tertile in follow-up RQ

**Recommendation:** Flag for manual investigation. Practice effect confound is most theoretically plausible and has precedent in retest literature. Consider analyzing only T1�T2 (first retest) to minimize accumulated practice, or use T1-only age differences as baseline (cross-sectional) comparison.

**2. LMM Prediction Anomalies (Visual-Statistical Contradiction):**

**Observation:** Age tertile predictions show implausible patterns (Young upturn, Middle extreme dip) not evident in raw data scatter.

**Why unexpected:** LMM should smooth trajectories, not create new features absent in observations.

**Explanation:**
- Age � Time interaction terms (though non-significant) interact with random slopes (Time | UID) to produce tertile-specific predictions
- When aggregating participant-level predictions to tertile means, small interaction coefficients can amplify into erratic patterns due to:
  - Unbalanced TSVR distribution (sparse data >170 hours)
  - Age � Time � Time_log three-way interplay creating local minima/maxima
  - Autocorrelation violation (ACF = -0.237) � residuals' temporal dependencies not modeled � predictions overcompensate

**Implication:** Tertile-level LMM predictions unreliable for this model. Age effects should be interpreted from fixed effect coefficients only, not from tertile trajectory visualizations.

---

**3. Negligible Individual Differences in Forgetting Rate (Random Slope Variance H 0):**

**Observation:** Random slope variance for Time = 0.000009 (effectively zero), compared to random intercept variance = 0.664 (large).

**Why unexpected:** Individuals should vary in forgetting rates (some forget fast, some slow), as documented in prior studies (e.g., individual differences in consolidation efficiency).

**Explanation:**
- Lin+Log functional form may fully capture forgetting trajectory shape for most participants
- Once logarithmic component (rapid early decline) and linear component (constant decay) are included, little residual variance in slopes remains
- Suggests forgetting follows universal trajectory shape (consolidation theory), with individual differences primarily in starting point (baseline ability), not decay rate

**Implication:** Age predicting slope (our RQ hypothesis) is challenging when slopes themselves show minimal between-person variation. Even if age affected forgetting, the signal would be tiny (� < 0.001) because the total slope variance to explain is tiny.

---

**4. Autocorrelation Violation Despite Longitudinal Design:**

**Observation:** Negative autocorrelation (Lag-1 ACF = -0.237), indicating consecutive timepoint residuals are negatively correlated.

**Why unexpected:** Positive autocorrelation common in longitudinal data (adjacent timepoints more similar), but negative autocorrelation suggests overcorrection.

**Explanation:**
- Model predicts too much decline from Time 1�2, then actual performance rebounds (residual positive at T2)
- Next prediction overcorrects upward, then performance declines again (residual negative at T3)
- Creates zigzag pattern in residuals characteristic of model misspecification
- Lin+Log form inherited from RQ 5.7 may not be optimal with Age interactions (Age may alter functional form, not just intercept/slope)

**Recommended remedial action:** Add AR(1) correlation structure to account for residual dependencies (per validation output), or test alternative functional forms (quadratic time, piecewise linear) in sensitivity analysis.

---

### Broader Implications

**REMEMVR Validation:**

- **Positive:** VR paradigm provides robust episodic memory measurement across age range 20-70 (no floor/ceiling effects in theta scores)
- **Concern:** If age effects on forgetting are negligible, REMEMVR may be insensitive to age-related consolidation deficits (limit utility for detecting subtle cognitive decline in aging research)
- **Alternative:** REMEMVR may be detecting a real phenomenon - that spatially-rich VR contexts equalize forgetting across ages, unlike decontextualized lab tasks

**Methodological Insights:**

1. **Practice effects in longitudinal designs:** Critical confound when testing age differences in trajectories. Four repeated assessments (T1-T4) introduce unknown practice � age interactions.
2. **IRT theta vs. raw accuracy:** Latent ability estimates may obscure age effects present in raw performance. Recommend dual reporting.
3. **Age as continuous predictor:** More powerful than group comparisons, but assumes linear age effects (may miss nonlinear accelerations after age 60)
4. **Bonferroni correction impact:** Uncorrected Age_c main effect p = 0.061 (marginal); corrected p = 0.182 (non-significant). Conservative correction appropriate for exploratory thesis, but may inflate Type II error.

**Theoretical Questions Raised:**

1. Do age effects on episodic memory depend on contextual richness of encoding environment? (VR vs. 2D comparison needed)
2. Are practice effects larger for younger adults, masking true age differences in forgetting?
3. Does hippocampal aging affect encoding (baseline) more than consolidation (forgetting rate) in cognitively healthy samples?
4. Is the dual deficit hypothesis specific to certain memory paradigms (verbal, decontextualized) rather than universal?

## 4. Limitations

### Sample Limitations

**Age Range and Distribution:**
- Sample spans 20-70 years, but critical accelerated decline period (60+) underrepresented (only 7 participants e65)
- Age distribution approximately uniform, lacking oversampling of older adults needed to detect nonlinear effects
- Recruitment excluded cognitively impaired individuals (no MCI/dementia), potentially selecting "super-agers" in older tertile
- **Implication:** Findings may not generalize to (a) very old adults (70+), (b) cognitively declining populations, or (c) unscreened community samples

**Sample Size for Age Effects:**
- N=100 participants provides adequate power (0.80) for medium effects (� e 0.03 on theta scale), but observed effects are trivial (� = 0.000-0.012)
- Post-hoc power for observed effect sizes: <0.20 (severely underpowered for tiny effects)
- **However:** Tight confidence intervals (SE = 0.001-0.007) suggest effects are precisely estimated as near-zero, not merely underpowered
- **Conclusion:** Null findings reflect true negligible effects, not insufficient sample size

**Missing Variables:**
- No cognitive screening scores (MMSE, MoCA) to characterize sample's cognitive health
- No education data to control for cognitive reserve confound
- No sleep quality, health, medication data (factors affecting consolidation)
- **Implication:** Age effects may be confounded with unmeasured health/education variables

### Methodological Limitations

**Design:**

1. **Practice Effects Confound:**
   - Four repeated VR tests introduce practice (learning how to navigate, remember spatial cues)
   - Practice � age interaction unknown (do younger adults benefit more from repeated testing?)
   - Cannot separate true forgetting from practice-attenuated decline
   - **Impact:** Age � Time interactions (forgetting rate differences) confounded with age � practice interactions
   - **Mitigation:** Random slopes (Time | UID) account for individual practice trajectories, but not age-moderated practice

2. **No Control Condition:**
   - Cannot compare VR forgetting to non-VR forgetting in same participants
   - VR-specific contextual scaffolding hypothesis untested
   - **Impact:** Unclear whether findings generalize to non-VR episodic memory paradigms

3. **Cross-Sectional Age Comparison:**
   - Age analyzed as between-subjects predictor (not longitudinal aging within-person)
   - Cohort effects possible (older adults grew up pre-digital era, younger adults digital natives)
   - **Impact:** Cannot attribute age effects to aging process vs. cohort differences

**Statistical:**

1. **Autocorrelation Violation:**
   - Lag-1 ACF = -0.237 (exceeds threshold 0.1), indicating model misspecification
   - Standard errors may be underestimated (inflating Type I error) or overestimated (inflating Type II error)
   - **Recommended remedial action:** AR(1) correlation structure (per validation output)
   - **Impact:** P-values and confidence intervals not fully trustworthy (though effects are so small that even 2� SE would not change conclusions)

2. **Lin+Log Functional Form Assumption:**
   - Inherited from RQ 5.7 as best-fitting model for overall sample
   - May not be optimal when testing age interactions (age could alter functional form itself, not just parameters)
   - Visual LMM prediction anomalies suggest interaction terms interact poorly with Lin+Log form
   - **Impact:** Age effects on forgetting may be present but in different functional form (e.g., age predicts quadratic component, not linear/log)

3. **Random Effects Structure:**
   - Random slopes for Time only (not Time_log) to avoid overparameterization
   - Assumes individual differences in logarithmic forgetting are fixed (no random variation)
   - May oversimplify participant heterogeneity
   - **Impact:** Age � Time_log interaction forced to explain variance that could be random individual differences

**Measurement:**

1. **IRT Theta Scaling:**
   - Theta scores are latent ability estimates, not raw performance
   - Transformation may obscure age effects present in raw accuracy (if older adults fail harder items at same rate)
   - **Check needed:** Compare age effects in raw accuracy vs. theta scores
   - **Impact:** Null age � forgetting findings may be artifact of IRT scaling assumptions

2. **Composite "All" Factor:**
   - Uses combined What/Where/When theta scores (from RQ 5.7)
   - Assumes age effects on forgetting are domain-general (same across What/Where/When)
   - Cannot test whether age differentially affects spatial vs. temporal vs. object memory forgetting
   - **Impact:** May miss domain-specific age � forgetting interactions

3. **TSVR Time Variable:**
   - Actual hours since encoding (1-246 hours range), not nominal days
   - Extreme variability in test timing (some T4 at 144h, one at 246h)
   - Sparse data beyond 170 hours (makes predictions at 200-250h unstable)
   - **Impact:** LMM extrapolations to late timepoints unreliable

### Generalizability Constraints

**Population:**
- Findings specific to cognitively healthy adults ages 20-70
- May not generalize to:
  - Older adults 70+ (accelerated decline period)
  - MCI/dementia patients (pathological aging)
  - Children/adolescents (developing episodic memory systems)
  - Non-WEIRD samples (cultural differences in spatial memory, aging attitudes)

**Context:**
- VR desktop paradigm (keyboard navigation, 2D monitor)
- May not generalize to:
  - Fully immersive HMD VR (greater embodiment, presence)
  - Real-world navigation (tactile, vestibular, olfactory cues)
  - Standard neuropsychological tests (word lists, 2D stimuli)
- Hypothesis: Age effects may be VR-attenuated (contextual support) and emerge in decontextualized paradigms

**Task:**
- REMEMVR-specific encoding task (10-minute VR shopping scenario)
- May not generalize to:
  - Naturalistic episodic memories (spontaneous, emotional, personally relevant)
  - Semantic memory (facts vs. events)
  - Procedural memory (skills)
- Hypothesis: Age effects on forgetting may be stronger for emotionally neutral VR memories vs. emotionally salient autobiographical memories

### Technical Limitations

**LMM Specification:**
- Lin+Log form may not capture age � functional form interactions
- AR(1) correlation structure not implemented (autocorrelation unmodeled)
- Three-way interaction (Age � Time � Time_log) not tested (current model assumes age effects additive across linear and log components)
- **Impact:** Model misspecification may obscure age effects present in different form

**Effect Size Interpretation:**
- Cohen's d-equivalent = 0.10 (trivial) for 1 SD age increase
- But: Theta scale's practical meaning unclear (0.10 theta = how many items correct?)
- No probability scale conversion (Decision D069 dual-scale interpretation not applicable for predictor effects, only outcome trajectories)
- **Impact:** Cannot interpret whether 0.10 theta difference is clinically meaningful

**Decision D068 Dual P-Value Reporting:**
- Bonferroni correction (� = 0.0167) very conservative for exploratory thesis context
- Uncorrected Age_c main effect p = 0.061 suggestive, but corrected p = 0.182 non-significant
- **Transparency achieved** (both p-values reported), but interpretation ambiguous
- **Impact:** Readers must judge whether marginal baseline age effect (p = 0.061) is scientifically meaningful despite Bonferroni rejection

### Limitations Summary

Despite constraints, findings are **robust within scope:**
- Age effects on forgetting consistently near-zero across multiple metrics (�, p-values, visual plots)
- Effect sizes trivial even with generous interpretation (uncorrected p-values)
- Null findings unlikely due to low power (tight CIs, large N)

Limitations primarily affect **generalizability** (healthy adults, VR context, practice confound) rather than **internal validity** of core conclusion: minimal age effects on forgetting rate in this sample/paradigm.

## 5. Next Steps

### Immediate Follow-Ups (Current Data)

**1. Practice Effect Decomposition (HIGH PRIORITY):**
- **Why:** Practice effects are most plausible explanation for wrong-direction age � forgetting interactions
- **How:**
  - Analyze T1�T2 transition only (first retest, minimal accumulated practice)
  - Test Age � Session interaction (does practice magnitude vary by age?)
  - Compare cross-sectional age differences at T1 (no practice) vs. T4 (maximum practice)
- **Expected Insight:** If younger adults show larger T1�T4 gains, this inflates their apparent "forgetting resistance" and masks true age effects
- **Timeline:** Immediate (use existing data, subset to T1-T2 or T1-only)

**2. Raw Accuracy vs. Theta Comparison (MEDIUM PRIORITY):**
- **Why:** IRT theta scaling may obscure age effects present in raw performance
- **How:**
  - Re-run LMM with raw accuracy (proportion correct) as DV instead of theta
  - Compare Age � Time interactions for accuracy vs. theta
  - Check whether older adults fail harder items (high b parameters) at higher rates
- **Expected Insight:** If age effects emerge in raw accuracy but not theta, IRT correction is removing genuine age variance
- **Timeline:** 2-3 days (requires re-extracting raw accuracy from master.xlsx, merging with TSVR/Age)

**3. Autocorrelation Remediation (MEDIUM PRIORITY):**
- **Why:** Validation flagged autocorrelation violation (ACF = -0.237), affecting inference validity
- **How:**
  - Refit LMM with AR(1) correlation structure using nlme::lme() or statsmodels GEE
  - Compare fixed effect estimates and p-values to original model
- **Expected Insight:** Determine whether age effect non-significance persists after correcting temporal dependencies
- **Timeline:** 1-2 days (requires switching to nlme package or GEE framework)

**4. Alternative Functional Forms (LOW PRIORITY - EXPLORATORY):**
- **Why:** Lin+Log form may not capture age � functional form interactions
- **How:**
  - Test Age � Time� (quadratic age effect on curvature)
  - Test piecewise linear (different age slopes 0-24h vs. 24-144h)
  - Compare AIC/BIC across functional forms
- **Expected Insight:** Age effects may manifest as altered trajectory shape (e.g., older adults' forgetting curves flatten earlier) rather than constant slope differences
- **Timeline:** 3-5 days (requires multiple model comparisons, diagnostic checks)

### Planned Thesis RQs (Chapter 5 Continuation)

**RQ 5.10 (Hypothetical - Domain-Specific Age Effects):**
- **Focus:** Does age differentially affect forgetting rates for What/Where/When domains?
- **Rationale:** This RQ used composite "All" theta scores; domain-specific analyses could reveal age � domain � time three-way interactions
- **Hypothesis:** Age effects may be stronger for temporal memory (When) vs. spatial memory (Where), given frontal lobe aging's impact on temporal sequencing
- **Builds On:** Uses RQ 5.7 domain-specific theta scores (theta_what, theta_where, theta_when) instead of theta_all
- **Expected Timeline:** If prioritized, ~1 week (similar LMM approach with domain as within-subjects factor)

**RQ 5.11 (Hypothetical - Nonlinear Age Effects):**
- **Focus:** Test segmented regression with age breakpoint at 60 years (per Online Cognitive Test 2022 findings)
- **Rationale:** Linear age assumption may miss accelerated decline in 60+ subsample (currently only 7 participants e65)
- **Requires:** Supplemental data collection to oversample 60-75 age range (current N too small)
- **Expected Timeline:** Beyond current thesis scope (requires new participants)

### Methodological Extensions (Future Data Collection)

**1. VR vs. 2D Control Comparison:**
- **Current Limitation:** Cannot isolate VR-specific contextual scaffolding effects
- **Extension:** Recruit N=50 matched controls, administer 2D slideshow version of REMEMVR task (same items, no navigation)
- **Hypothesis:** Age � forgetting interactions will emerge in 2D condition (lacking contextual cues) but remain null in VR
- **Expected Insight:** Test whether VR's spatial richness equalizes forgetting across ages
- **Feasibility:** Requires 2D task development and new data collection (~6 months)

**2. Single-Session Design (Eliminate Practice Effects):**
- **Current Limitation:** Four repeated tests confound forgetting with practice
- **Extension:** Between-subjects design with random assignment to test at Day 0, 1, 3, or 6 (each participant tested once)
- **Hypothesis:** Age � Time interactions will emerge without practice confound
- **Trade-off:** Loses statistical power (no within-subject pairing), requires 4� sample size for equivalent power
- **Feasibility:** Requires N=400 new participants (~2 years data collection)

**3. Expanded Age Range (70-90 years):**
- **Current Limitation:** Underrepresentation of accelerated decline period (60+)
- **Extension:** Oversample 65-90 age range (target N=50 older adults)
- **Hypothesis:** Nonlinear age effects will emerge with sufficient variance in rapid-decline range
- **Expected Insight:** Test segmented regression with breakpoint at age 60
- **Feasibility:** Requires community outreach to older adult populations, cognitive screening for safety (~1 year)

**4. Cognitive Reserve Covariates:**
- **Current Limitation:** Age confounded with education, health, cognitive reserve
- **Extension:** Add MMSE, education years, vocabulary (WAIS), SES to model
- **Hypothesis:** Age effects will attenuate after controlling for cognitive reserve (age may proxy for education in this sample)
- **Expected Insight:** Determine whether age per se affects forgetting, or whether age is marker for reserve/health confounds
- **Feasibility:** Immediate for new data collection (add 15-minute cognitive battery)

### Theoretical Questions Raised

**1. Does Contextual Richness Modulate Age Effects on Forgetting?**
- **Question:** Are age-related forgetting differences attenuated in spatially rich VR environments vs. decontextualized lab tasks?
- **Next Steps:** Meta-analysis comparing age effect sizes (� for Age � Time) across VR vs. non-VR episodic memory studies
- **Expected Insight:** If VR studies show consistently smaller age effects, supports environmental support hypothesis (Craik, 1986)
- **Feasibility:** Literature review feasible (~1 month), empirical test requires VR vs. 2D comparison study

**2. Are Practice Effects Age-Dependent in Episodic Memory?**
- **Question:** Do younger adults show larger retest gains (practice effects) than older adults in episodic memory tasks?
- **Next Steps:** Systematic review of age � retest session interactions in longitudinal memory studies
- **Expected Insight:** If younger adults benefit more from practice, current RQ's wrong-direction age effects are explained
- **Feasibility:** Literature review immediate; empirical test requires controlled practice manipulation

**3. Does Hippocampal Aging Affect Encoding More Than Consolidation?**
- **Question:** Is age-related episodic memory decline primarily an encoding deficit (intercept) rather than consolidation deficit (slope)?
- **Next Steps:** Individual differences analysis - correlate hippocampal volume (from neuroimaging) with baseline theta (intercept) vs. forgetting rate (slope)
- **Expected Insight:** If hippocampal volume predicts intercepts but not slopes, challenges dual deficit hypothesis
- **Feasibility:** Requires MRI data (beyond thesis scope, long-term collaboration)

**4. Is the Dual Deficit Hypothesis Paradigm-Specific?**
- **Question:** Do older adults show dual deficits (encoding + forgetting) in verbal tasks but not spatial VR tasks?
- **Next Steps:** Within-subjects design with both verbal memory test (word lists) and VR spatial memory test in same participants
- **Expected Insight:** Task � age � time three-way interaction would reveal domain-specificity of aging effects
- **Feasibility:** Feasible within thesis scope (~1 month data collection, N=100)

### Priority Ranking

**High Priority (Do First):**
1. Practice effect decomposition (T1-T2 analysis) - explains wrong-direction findings, immediate
2. Raw accuracy vs. theta comparison - tests IRT artifact hypothesis, ~2 days
3. RQ 5.10 domain-specific age effects (if prioritized) - natural extension, uses existing data

**Medium Priority (Subsequent):**
1. Autocorrelation remediation (AR1 model) - validates inference, ~2 days
2. Alternative functional forms - exploratory robustness check, ~3-5 days
3. Cognitive reserve covariates - for future data only (current sample lacks these measures)

**Lower Priority (Aspirational):**
1. VR vs. 2D control - ideal but requires new data collection (~6 months)
2. Single-session design - eliminates practice confound but requires large N (~2 years)
3. MRI hippocampal volume correlation - long-term collaboration, beyond thesis

### Next Steps Summary

The null findings (minimal age effects on forgetting) raise a critical question: **Real null or confounded by practice effects?**

**Three immediate investigations:**
1. **T1-T2 analysis:** Test whether age effects emerge when limiting to first retest (minimal practice)
2. **Raw accuracy analysis:** Test whether IRT theta scaling removes genuine age variance
3. **Practice � age interaction:** Test whether younger adults show larger retest gains

If all three investigations confirm null age effects, findings have important theoretical implications: **VR's contextual richness may equalize forgetting across ages**, challenging the generality of the dual deficit hypothesis and suggesting environmental support as a viable intervention for age-related memory decline.

If practice confound is confirmed (younger adults benefit more from retesting), **recommend single-session design for future aging studies** or statistical control for cumulative practice effects.
