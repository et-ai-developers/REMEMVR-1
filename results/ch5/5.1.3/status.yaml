    6 analysis steps planned (Step 0: data merge + Steps 1-5: LMM analysis).
    Pipeline: DERIVED data (RQ 5.7 theta + Age) -> Age centering -> LMM (Age x Time) -> Effect size -> Plot prep.
    Tool requirements: Data merge, grand-mean centering, Lin+Log LMM with Age x Time interactions, Bonferroni correction (α=0.0167), age tertile aggregation.
    Expected outputs: 9 files (4 data, 3 results, 2 plots source CSVs). Validation required at every step.

    Results validated for scientific plausibility
    4 anomalies flagged: 2 wrong direction (Age x Time interactions positive), 1 model violation (autocorrelation), 1 visual-statistical contradiction (LMM predictions implausible)
    Null hypothesis: Age effects on forgetting minimal/non-significant (all p > 0.18 Bonferroni)
