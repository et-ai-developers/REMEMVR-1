    6 analysis steps planned (Step 0: data merge + Steps 1-5: LMM analysis).
    Pipeline: DERIVED data (RQ 5.1.1 theta + Age) -> Age centering -> LMM (Age x Time) -> Effect size -> Plot prep.
    Tool requirements: Data merge, grand-mean centering, Lin+Log LMM with Age x Time interactions, Bonferroni correction (α=0.0167), age tertile aggregation.
    Expected outputs: 9 files (4 data, 3 results, 2 plots source CSVs). Validation required at every step.

    GOLD STATUS ACHIEVED (2025-12-09)
    Extended model comparison + model averaging complete
    40 functional forms tested with Age × Time interactions

    KEY FINDINGS:
    - Model-averaged Age_c: β=-0.011, SE=0.016, p=0.48 (NULL)
    - Model-averaged Time:Age_c: β=0.000022, SE=0.00044, p=0.96 (NULL)
    - Model-averaged Time_log:Age_c: β=0.0013, SE=0.0090, p=0.89 (NULL)

    ROBUSTNESS: NULL confirmed across PowerLaw, Log, SquareRoot, Reciprocal, and combined models

    INTERPRETATION: VR Scaffolding Hypothesis - Immersive environmental context compensates for age-related hippocampal decline

    METHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTION: Wrong-direction artifacts (original Lin+Log) resolved via model averaging
