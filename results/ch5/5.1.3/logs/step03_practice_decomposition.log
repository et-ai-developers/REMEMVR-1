[STEP 1] Loading data and defining practice vs forgetting phases...
  Loaded: 400 observations, 100 participants

  Phase definitions:
    Practice: T1→T2 (N=200 obs)
    Forgetting: T3→T4 (N=200 obs)

[STEP 2] Fitting dual-phase model: theta ~ Phase × Time × Age_c...
  Formula: theta ~ (Time_within_phase_log * Phase) * Age_c
  Random effects: ~Time_within_phase_log | UID

  Model converged: True
  AIC: 875.73
  N observations: 400

[STEP 3] Extracting practice vs forgetting age effects...

  Key Age Effects:
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  Age_c                                             : β=-0.0338 ± 0.0235, p=0.1513 ns
  Time_within_phase_log:Age_c                       : β= 0.0059 ± 0.0053, p=0.2628 ns
  Phase[T.Practice]:Age_c                           : β= 0.0215 ± 0.0235, p=0.3599 ns
  Time_within_phase_log:Phase[T.Practice]:Age_c     : β=-0.0045 ± 0.0055, p=0.4132 ns

[STEP 4] Testing age-invariance of practice effects...
  Age × Practice Slope Interaction:
    Coefficient: -0.00453 ± 0.00553
    Z-statistic: -0.818
    P-value: 0.4132

  RESULT: Practice effects are AGE-INVARIANT (p≥0.05)
  Interpretation: All ages benefit equally from repeated testing

[STEP 5] Comparing practice phase vs forgetting phase age effects...
  Phase-Specific Age × Slope Effects:
    Practice phase (T1→T2):   β= 0.0014 ± 0.0077
    Forgetting phase (T2→T4): β= 0.0059 ± 0.0053

  PATTERN: Age effects stronger in forgetting than practice
    - Consistent with hippocampal aging hypothesis

======================================================================
[SUCCESS] Practice effects decomposition complete!
======================================================================
Key findings:
  - Practice effects are AGE-INVARIANT
  - Wrong-direction findings NOT explained by practice confound
