[STEP 1] Loading prepared LMM input...
  Loaded: 400 rows, 100 participants
  Age_c range: [-24.57, 25.43]
  Time range: [1.00, 246.24] hours

[STEP 2] Adding 66-model time transformations...
  Added 25 time transforms

[STEP 3] Defining 66-model suite...
  Defined 65 models for age interaction testing
  Each model formula: theta ~ (time_transform) * Age_c
  Age effects tested: Intercept (Age_c), Slope (time:Age_c)

[STEP 4] Fitting 66 models with Age interactions...
  Random effects: ~Time | UID (random intercepts + slopes)
  Estimation: LBFGS, REML=False
