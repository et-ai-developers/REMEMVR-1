    Created results/ch5/rq15/ with 6 folders
    Folders: docs/, data/, code/, logs/, plots/, results/
    All folders empty, ready for agents
    status.yaml initialized with 10 RQ-specific agents
    Next: rq_concept extracts concept from thesis

    RQ 5.15: Item Difficulty × Time Interaction (cross-level)
    Domains: What/Where/When (all domains, match RQ 5.1 IRT calibration)
    Analysis: Cross-classified LMM (pymer4) - Time × Difficulty_c + (Time|UID) + (1|Item)
    Data: DERIVED (RQ 5.1 difficulty estimates) + RAW (response data from dfData.csv)
    Critical: Requires pymer4 for crossed random effects, Bonferroni α=0.0033, exploratory (no directional hypothesis)

rq_scholar:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.3/10 APPROVED. Theory excellent (competing predictions), 12 papers reviewed, 5 suggested improvements (add recent citations, acknowledge practice effects). Ready for stats.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.3/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 2.9/3 (excellent, model selection + random slopes justified). Cat2: 1.7/2 (validation tools used). Cat3: 1.8/2 (parameters clear, slopes justified). Cat4: 1.9/2 (comprehensive validation, Step 4.5 added). Cat5: 1.0/1 (5 concerns, all cited). All required changes addressed.

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    6 analysis steps planned (Step 0: load/merge data + Steps 1-5: center, LMM, extract, validate, plot)
    LMM only (no IRT - uses DERIVED difficulty from RQ 5.1)
    Cross-classified random effects (UID x Item) via pymer4, model selection strategy documented
    RQ 5.1 dependencies: step03_difficulty.csv, step00_tsvr_mapping.csv, dfData.csv
    Validation: All steps have 4-layer substance criteria, comprehensive LMM assumptions (Step 4)
