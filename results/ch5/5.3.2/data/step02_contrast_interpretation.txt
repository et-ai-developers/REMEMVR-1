RQ 5.4 - Linear Trend Contrast Analysis
==========================================

RESEARCH QUESTION:
Is there a systematic linear trend in forgetting rates across paradigms
(Free Recall -> Cued Recall -> Recognition)?

CONTRAST SPECIFICATION:
- Weights: Free_Recall = -1, Cued_Recall = 0, Recognition = +1
- Tests: Linear trend in SLOPES (forgetting rates), not intercepts

RESULTS:
- Contrast estimate: -0.1274
- Standard error: 0.0515
- z-value: -2.474
- p-value (uncorrected): = 0.013
- p-value (Bonferroni-corrected, n=15): 0.2003
- 95% CI: [-0.2284, -0.0265]

SIGNIFICANCE:
- Uncorrected (alpha = 0.05): SIGNIFICANT
- Bonferroni-corrected: NOT SIGNIFICANT

INTERPRETATION:
The linear trend contrast estimate is negative.
This means forgetting rate INCREASES from Free Recall to Recognition.
In practical terms: More retrieval support is associated with FASTER forgetting.

PARADIGM-SPECIFIC SLOPES (for reference):
- Free Recall: -0.4697 (slowest forgetting - least negative)
- Cued Recall: -0.5203
- Recognition: -0.5971 (fastest forgetting - most negative)

Note: All slopes are negative because theta decreases over time (forgetting).
A more negative slope = faster forgetting.
A less negative slope = slower forgetting.

STATISTICAL NOTE (D068):
Per thesis decision D068, we report both uncorrected and Bonferroni-corrected
p-values. The Bonferroni correction accounts for 15 planned comparisons across
the thesis to control the family-wise error rate.
