RQ 5.2.1 - Model Averaging Summary (Domain × Time)
================================================================================

Problem: Best single model uncertainty
  Best model: Recip+Log
  Akaike weight: 0.0890 (8.9%)
  Interpretation: EXTREME uncertainty

Solution: Multi-model inference (Burnham & Anderson, 2002)
  Models averaged: 10
  Effective N models: 9.45
  Cumulative weight: 54.8%

Models Used (Top 10):
   1. Recip+Log                 w=0.1623
   2. PowerLaw_Log              w=0.1482
   3. CubeRoot+Log              w=0.1363
   4. Tanh+Log                  w=0.1014
   5. SquareRoot+Lin            w=0.0858
   6. Lin+Log                   w=0.0855
   7. Exp+Log                   w=0.0855
   8. Recip+Lin                 w=0.0715
   9. PowerLaw+Recip+Log        w=0.0621
  10. PowerLaw_Lin              w=0.0615

Model Composition:
  Reciprocal family: 3 models (two-process forgetting)
  Power-law family: 3 models (scale-invariant decay)
  Logarithmic family: 5 models (Ebbinghaus curves)

Effective Functional Form:
  Dominant family: Reciprocal+Log (two-process)
  Interpretation: Rapid initial consolidation + slow asymptotic decay
  Domain interaction: Time transformation × Domain effects

Robustness:
  Single-model risk: Overfitting, ignores uncertainty
  Averaged approach: Accounts for functional form uncertainty
  Ph.D. defense: Scientifically defensible foundation
