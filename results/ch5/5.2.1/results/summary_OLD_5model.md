## 2. Plot Descriptions

### Figure 1: Domain-Specific Forgetting Trajectories - Theta Scale

**Filename:** `plots/trajectory_theta.png`
**Plot Type:** Line plot with observed means (points) and fitted curves (lines)
**Generated By:** Step 07 plot data preparation + plots.py execution

**Visual Description:**

The plot displays forgetting trajectories across 4 test sessions (TSVR: 0-150 hours) for three memory domains:

- **X-axis:** Hours Since VR Encoding (TSVR) - 0 to ~150 hours
- **Y-axis:** Memory Ability (Theta) - range approximately -0.5 to 0.7

**Domain Trajectories (Theta Scale):**

| Domain | Day 0 (mean) | Day 6 (mean) | Decline |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| What (red) | 0.69 | -0.34 | 1.03 SD |
| Where (blue) | 0.67 | -0.48 | 1.15 SD |
| When (green) | 0.20 | -0.11 | 0.31 SD |

**Key Patterns Observed:**

1. **All domains show monotonic decline** - consistent with forgetting curve (Ebbinghaus)
2. **Logarithmic decay pattern** - steep initial forgetting (Day 0-1), slower later decline (Day 3-6)
3. **What and Where trajectories overlap** - similar baseline and trajectories
4. **When domain consistently lower** - starts lower (theta ~0.2 vs ~0.7), ends higher (theta ~-0.1 vs ~-0.4)
5. **When domain shows slower decline** - shallower trajectory despite lower baseline
6. **Observed means (circles) match fitted lines** - good model fit

**Connection to Findings:**
- Logarithmic model best fit confirmed visually (curved trajectories, not linear)
- When domain difference visible (lower throughout), matches significant When-What contrast (p<.001)
- Where-What overlap visible, matches non-significant contrast (p=.722)

### Figure 2: Domain-Specific Forgetting Trajectories - Probability Scale

**Filename:** `plots/trajectory_probability.png`
**Plot Type:** Line plot with observed means (points) and fitted curves (lines)
**Generated By:** Step 07 plot data preparation + plots.py execution (Decision D069 dual-scale)

**Visual Description:**

The plot displays recall probability across 4 test sessions, transformed from theta scale:

- **X-axis:** Hours Since VR Encoding (TSVR) - 0 to ~150 hours
- **Y-axis:** Probability Correct (%) - range 0 to ~90%

**Domain Trajectories (Probability Scale):**

| Domain | Day 0 (prob) | Day 6 (prob) | Decline |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| What (red) | 88% | 72% | 16 pp |
| Where (blue) | 61% | 38% | 23 pp |
| When (green) | 9% | 6% | 3 pp |

**Key Patterns Observed:**

1. **What domain highest performance** - 88% to 72% (substantially above chance)
2. **Where domain moderate performance** - 61% to 38% (declining toward chance)
3. **When domain near floor** - 9% to 6% (essentially at floor throughout)
4. **Clear domain separation** - three distinct bands visible
5. **Probability transformation reveals practical differences** - When domain's low discrimination means theta changes minimally affect probability

**Connection to Findings:**
- Probability scale reveals practical significance: What domain retains 72% at Day 6 (clinically meaningful)
- When domain at ~6-9% throughout (FLOOR EFFECT - see Limitations Section 4)
- Where domain shows largest percentage point decline (23 pp), but remains above chance at Day 6

## 3. Interpretation

### Hypothesis Testing

**Original Hypothesis (from 1_concept.md):**
"Object identity (What) may be more resilient than spatial (Where) or temporal (When) memory, consistent with dual-process theories suggesting familiarity-based information is less hippocampus-dependent than contextual details."

**Hypothesis Status:** PARTIALLY SUPPORTED - with important caveats

**Evidence:**
- What domain shows HIGHEST performance (88% -> 72%) consistent with familiarity advantage
- Where domain shows SIMILAR theta trajectory to What (-0.030 interaction, p=.711)
- When domain shows SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT pattern - but due to floor effects, not differential forgetting

**Interpretation:**
The hypothesis predicted What > Where > When resilience. Results show:
- What = Where (no significant difference in forgetting rates)
- When is fundamentally different (starts near floor, stays at floor)

### Dual-Scale Trajectory Interpretation (Decision D069)

**Theta Scale Findings:**

Memory ability declined logarithmically over 6 days for all domains:
- What: Declined 1.03 SD (theta 0.69 -> -0.34)
- Where: Declined 1.15 SD (theta 0.67 -> -0.48)
- When: Declined 0.31 SD (theta 0.20 -> -0.11)

**Statistical Interpretation:**

The main effect of log(Days) was significant (z = -8.65, p < .001, f2 = 0.062 [small effect]). The logarithmic form indicates rapid initial forgetting followed by stabilization - consistent with classic forgetting curve. When domain showed significantly slower theta decline (z = 4.25, p < .001 for log_Days x When interaction).

**Probability Scale Findings:**

Transforming to probability scale reveals qualitatively different patterns:
- What: 88% -> 72% (16 percentage point decline, still well above chance)
- Where: 61% -> 38% (23 percentage point decline, approaching chance)
- When: 9% -> 6% (3 percentage point decline, AT FLOOR)

**Practical Interpretation:**

The probability scale reveals that When domain performance is at FLOOR throughout the study (6-9%). This is NOT meaningful forgetting - participants cannot perform the temporal ordering task at any time point. The apparent "slower forgetting" in theta space for When domain is an artifact of floor effects.

**Why Both Scales Matter:**
- Theta scale: Shows psychometric trajectory, suggests When domain "forgets slower"
- Probability scale: Reveals When domain is AT FLOOR (9%), making theta changes uninformative
- Together: Prevent misinterpretation of When domain as "resilient" when it's actually "untestable"

### Domain-Specific Insights

**What Domain (Object Identity):**
- Highest baseline performance (88%) and retention (72%)
- Consistent with familiarity-based recognition being robust
- Suggests VR object encoding is effective and durable
- Only 19/29 items retained (66%), but adequate coverage

**Where Domain (Spatial Location):**
- Similar trajectory to What domain (non-significant difference)
- Moderate baseline (61%) with larger percentage decline (23 pp)
- 45/50 items retained (90%) - excellent coverage
- Suggests spatial memory in VR comparable to object memory

**When Domain (Temporal Order):**
- CRITICAL: Only 6/26 items retained (23%) after purification
- Performance at floor (6-9%) throughout study
- Low discrimination (most items a < 0.4) prevented retention
- Results for When domain should be interpreted with extreme caution

### Unexpected Patterns

**1. When Domain Floor Effect (ANOMALY - requires investigation)**

- **Type:** Implausible result due to measurement floor
- **Description:** When domain probability ranges 6-9% across all time points, near floor (0%)
- **Investigation:** Examine When items - are they too difficult? Is temporal ordering inherently harder in VR? Were encoding instructions adequate for temporal information?
- **Impact:** Cannot meaningfully interpret When domain forgetting trajectory

**2. When Domain Item Attrition**

- **Type:** Sample attrition concern
- **Description:** 20/26 When items (77%) excluded for low discrimination (a < 0.4)
- **Investigation:** Check item content - temporal order questions may have ambiguous correct answers, insufficient temporal cues during encoding, or floor effects making discrimination impossible
- **Impact:** Only 6 When items limits reliability and generalizability

**3. Logarithmic vs Linear Time**

- **Type:** Unexpected pattern (positive finding)
- **Description:** Log model substantially better than Linear (delta AIC = 31.4)
- **Interpretation:** Forgetting follows classic Ebbinghaus curve with rapid initial decay. This is expected but confirms TSVR (actual hours) captures continuous forgetting better than nominal days.

### Broader Implications

**REMEMVR Validation:**
- What and Where domains show valid forgetting trajectories
- When domain requires redesign - current items do not discriminate
- VR encoding appears effective for object and spatial information

**Methodological Insights:**
1. **IRT Purification Critical (D039):** Removing 35/105 items improved model fit; When domain particularly affected
2. **TSVR vs Nominal Days (D070):** Logarithmic time effect (AIC weight = 62%) validates continuous time modeling
3. **Dual-Scale Reporting (D069):** Essential for detecting floor effects (When domain looks "resilient" on theta scale, but is at floor on probability scale)

---

## 4. Limitations

### Sample Limitations

- **Sample size:** N=100 adequate for main effects (power ~0.80 for medium effects) but limited for Domain x Time interactions with 3 levels
- **Demographics:** University sample limits generalizability to older adults, clinical populations
- **Attrition:** 0% dropout is atypical - may reflect highly motivated sample

### Methodological Limitations

**IRT Purification Impact (Decision D039):**
- 35/105 items excluded (33%)
- When domain severely affected: only 6/26 items retained (23%)
- Potential domain imbalance: What=19, Where=45, When=6 items
- When domain reliability likely compromised with only 6 items

**When Domain Floor Effect:**
- Performance 6-9% throughout study (near 0% floor)
- Cannot meaningfully interpret When domain forgetting
- Low discrimination (20 items a < 0.4) suggests items failed to differentiate ability levels
- May require task redesign rather than analysis adjustment

**Design Constraints:**
- No baseline encoding test (Day 0 is first retrieval, not encoding)
- Practice effects across 4 sessions not modeled
- Temporal order encoding quality unknown

### Technical Limitations

**IRT Model:**
- Pass 2 showed 4 items marginally outside D039 bounds (expected IRT drift)
- 5/1200 theta values marginally outside [-3, 3] range (acceptable)
- When domain with only 6 items may have unstable parameter estimates

**LMM Assumptions:**
- Logarithmic time assumes specific functional form (validated by AIC comparison)
- Random slopes assume all participants have individual forgetting rates
- Residual variance (0.705) suggests substantial unexplained variation

**Dual-Scale Transformation (D069):**
- Uses domain-specific average discrimination and difficulty parameters
- When domain's low discrimination (mean a ~ 1.2) compresses probability range
- Non-linear transformation at extremes may distort confidence intervals

### Generalizability Constraints

- **Population:** Healthy young adults; findings may not apply to aging or clinical populations
- **Context:** Desktop VR; HMD immersive VR may show different patterns
- **Task:** REMEMVR-specific paradigm; may not generalize to other episodic memory tests

## 5. Next Steps

### Immediate Follow-Ups

**1. When Domain Item Analysis (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Why:** 77% item exclusion and floor effects require investigation
- **How:** Examine excluded When items - difficulty distributions, response patterns, item content
- **Expected insight:** Determine if temporal order task is fundamentally flawed or items need redesign

**2. Sensitivity Analysis for Purification Thresholds**
- **Why:** D039 thresholds (a >= 0.4, |b| <= 3.0) may be too strict for When domain
- **How:** Test relaxed thresholds (a >= 0.3, |b| <= 4.0) and compare results
- **Expected insight:** Determine if When domain results robust to threshold choice

### Planned Thesis RQs

**RQ 5.2-5.X (Related Analyses):**
- May examine domain-specific curves in more detail
- Should consider excluding When domain or treating separately given floor effects
- Consider What and Where as primary endpoints, When as exploratory

### Methodological Extensions

**1. When Domain Redesign**
- Add temporal cues during VR encoding (explicit timeline, sequence markers)
- Reduce difficulty of temporal order questions
- Consider fewer, higher-quality temporal items

**2. Alternative Time Models**
- Test exponential decay (Ebbinghaus) explicitly
- Consider day-of-week effects (circadian, interference patterns)

### Theoretical Questions

**1. Why Does When Domain Fail?**
- Is temporal order inherently harder to encode in VR?
- Does VR lack naturalistic temporal cues (no real-time passage)?
- Are participants encoding spatial/object information but ignoring sequence?

**2. Why Are What and Where Equivalent?**
- Hypothesis predicted What > Where (familiarity advantage)
- Results show no difference - does VR enhance spatial encoding to match object encoding?
- Or are both relying on similar hippocampal processes in VR context?

### Priority Ranking

**High Priority:**
1. When domain item analysis - resolve floor effect mystery
2. Exclude When domain from subsequent RQs until resolved
3. Proceed with What/Where as primary domains

**Medium Priority:**
1. Sensitivity analysis for purification thresholds
2. Individual difference analysis (slope variance is substantial)

**Lower Priority:**
1. Alternative IRT dimensionality (1D vs 3D)
2. Practice effects modeling
