[MERGED] 100 participants with features + cluster assignments
[PREPARED] Feature matrix X: shape (100, 2) (100 participants x 2 features)
[PREPARED] Cluster labels: 100 participants, 2 unique clusters
[INFO] Cluster sizes: {0: 69, 1: 31}
[ANALYSIS] Computing silhouette coefficient using Euclidean metric...
[COMPUTED] Silhouette coefficient: 0.5943
[INTERPRETATION] Reasonable cluster structure found
[DETAIL] Clusters have moderate separation and cohesion (0.50 <= silhouette < 0.70)
