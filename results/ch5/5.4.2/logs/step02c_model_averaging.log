================================================================================
[LOAD] Loading input data and model comparison...
  Training data: 1200 observations
  Models compared: 65
  Congruence levels: ['Common', 'Congruent', 'Incongruent']
  Best single model: PowerLaw_01 (weight=0.0604)
  Competitive models (ΔAIC<2): 15
  Cumulative weight: 56.4%

[GRID] Creating prediction grid...
  Grid points: 300 (100 per congruence level)

[AVERAGING] Computing model-averaged predictions...
  NOTE: Congruence × Time interaction - averaging across functional forms

[RESULTS] Model averaging complete:
  Models used: 15
  Effective N models: 13.96
  Prediction variance: [0.0000, 0.0019]

[COMPOSITION] Model types in competitive set:
