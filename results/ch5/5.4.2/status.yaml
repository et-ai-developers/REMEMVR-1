  context_dump: 'RQ 5.4.2: Schema congruence consolidation vs decay

    Domains: N/A - items categorized by congruence (Congruent/Common/Incongruent),

    Analysis: Piecewise LMM (Early Days 0-1, Late Days 1-6) + 3-way interaction

    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.4.1 theta scores (results/ch5/5.4.1/data/step03_theta_scores.csv)

    Critical: Tests sleep consolidation theory - congruent benefit during Early segment
    (one night sleep)

    Pipeline: LMM-only (uses DERIVED theta from RQ 5.4.1, no IRT calibration)

    Key analysis: Piecewise LMM with 3-way interaction (Days_within x Segment x Congruence)
    tests consolidation vs decay

    Expected outputs: LMM model, 6 segment-specific slopes, 11 hypothesis tests, assumption
