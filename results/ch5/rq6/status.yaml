    RQ 5.6: Schema congruence consolidation vs decay
    Domains: N/A - items categorized by congruence (Congruent/Common/Incongruent), not WWW
    Analysis: Piecewise LMM (Early Days 0-1, Late Days 1-6) + 3-way interaction
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.5 theta scores (results/ch5/rq5/data/step03_theta_scores.csv)
    Critical: Tests sleep consolidation theory - congruent benefit during Early segment (one night sleep)

rq_scholar:

  context_dump: |
    9.3/10 APPROVED. Strong piecewise consolidation theory, good literature. Suggest: add practice effects discussion, acknowledge post-consolidation schema timing, nuance critical window claim.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.6/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 3.0/3 (exceptional piecewise LMM design). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 2.0/2 (comprehensive params). Cat4: 1.8/2 (strong validation, minor theta weighting concern). Cat5: 0.8/1 (10 concerns, good quality). Section 7 resolved 8.9/10 REJECTED status. Suggest: elevate theta weighting, acknowledge N=100 limitation.

  context_dump: |
    7 analysis steps planned (Step 0: RQ 5.5 theta extraction + Steps 1-6: piecewise LMM)
    Pipeline: LMM-only (uses DERIVED theta from RQ 5.5, no IRT calibration)
    Key analysis: Piecewise LMM with 3-way interaction (Days_within x Segment x Congruence) tests consolidation vs decay
    Expected outputs: LMM model, 6 segment-specific slopes, 11 hypothesis tests, assumption validation, 2 plot source CSVs
    Validation: Per-step validation mandatory (100% coverage with 4-layer substance criteria)

rq_tools:
  status: success
  completed: 2025-11-25 12:06
  context_dump: |
    4 catalogued + 8 missing piecewise tools identified (INLINE strategy approved)
    Catalogued: fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr, extract_fixed_effects, compute_contrasts_pairwise, convert_theta_to_probability
    Missing: Piecewise-specific tools (extract_segment_slopes, assign_piecewise_segments, assumption validation, sensitivity analyses, plot data prep)
    Strategy: Inline implementation per RQ 5.2 pattern, extract to tools/ after RQ 5.6 validation
    All signatures documented in 3_tools.yaml for g_code reference

  status: success
  timestamp: "2025-11-25T14:16:00"
  context_dump: |
    7 steps specified with validation (Piecewise LMM consolidation vs decay analysis)
    Step 0: stdlib (RQ 5.5 theta extraction), Steps 1-6: 3 catalogued + 4 inline tools
    All step types: stdlib (1), catalogued (3), inline (3) - INLINE per RQ 5.2 pattern
    Complete specifications: Full signatures, input/output formats, parameters, validation criteria
    Key outputs: Piecewise LMM model, 6 segment slopes, 11 hypothesis tests, assumption validation, 2 plot CSVs
