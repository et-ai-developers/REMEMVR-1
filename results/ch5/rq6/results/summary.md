### Segment-Specific Slopes (theta/day)

| Segment | Congruence | Slope | SE | 95% CI | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------|-------|-------|---------|----------------|
| Early | Common | -0.263 | 0.164 | [-0.585, 0.059] | decline (n.s.) |
| Early | Congruent | -0.253 | 0.164 | [-0.575, 0.069] | decline (n.s.) |
| Early | Incongruent | -0.320 | 0.164 | [-0.642, 0.002] | decline (marginal) |
| Late | Common | -0.093 | 0.020 | [-0.133, -0.053] | decline (p < .001) |
| Late | Congruent | -0.101 | 0.020 | [-0.141, -0.061] | decline (p < .001) |
| Late | Incongruent | -0.090 | 0.020 | [-0.130, -0.050] | decline (p < .001) |

**Key Pattern:** All slopes negative (forgetting over time). Early segment slopes steeper (-0.25 to -0.32 theta/day) but with wide confidence intervals (non-significant). Late segment slopes shallower (-0.09 to -0.10 theta/day) but precisely estimated (all significant).

### Cross-Reference to plan.md Expectations

**Expected:** Piecewise model should fit better than continuous time models if consolidation vs decay are distinct processes.

**Actual:** Sensitivity analysis shows **continuous time models fit better** (see Sensitivity Analyses below).

## 2. Plot Descriptions

### Figure 1: Piecewise Trajectory by Congruence (Two-Panel Early|Late)

**Filename:** `piecewise_trajectory.png`
**Plot Type:** Two-panel line plot (Early segment | Late segment)
**Generated By:** rq_plots agent (Step 16 workflow)

**Visual Description:**

**Left Panel - Early Segment (Days 0-1):**
- X-axis: Days Since VR Encoding (within segment): 0 to 1 day
- Y-axis: Memory Ability (Theta): -0.4 to 0.6
- Three lines: Common (gray), Congruent (green), Incongruent (red)
- Observed means: Two timepoints per line (Day 0 encoding, Day 1)
- Model predictions: Smooth declining trajectories

**Visual Patterns (Early):**
- All three congruence types show decline from Day 0 to Day 1
- Incongruent items start highest (~0.52 theta) and decline most steeply
- Congruent items intermediate trajectory (~0.43 ’ ~0.18)
- Common items show moderate decline (~0.46 ’ ~0.20)
- Wide confidence intervals (error bars) reflect high within-segment variability
- Lines nearly parallel (minimal congruence × time interaction)

**Right Panel - Late Segment (Days 1-6):**
- X-axis: Days Since Day 1 (within segment): 0 to 6 days
- Y-axis: Memory Ability (Theta): -1.2 to 0.5
- Three lines: Common (gray), Congruent (green), Incongruent (red)
- Observed means: Three timepoints per line (Day 1, Day 3, Day 6)
- Model predictions: Smooth declining trajectories

**Visual Patterns (Late):**
- All three congruence types show gradual decline from Day 1 to Day 6
- Congruent items decline from ~0.0 to ~-0.6 theta over 6 days
- Common items decline from ~0.0 to ~-0.55 theta
- Incongruent items decline from ~-0.1 to ~-0.6 theta
- Narrower confidence intervals (more precise estimates with more data)
- Lines nearly parallel (no congruence × time interaction)

**Key Visual Insight:**
Slopes appear similar across congruence types within each segment. Early segment shows steeper decline but less precise. Late segment shows shallower, more reliable decline. **No visual evidence of differential consolidation benefit for congruent items.**

**Connection to Findings:**
Visual trajectories confirm statistical null result: 3-way interaction non-significant (p = .938). Congruence types do not differ in their Early vs Late slope patterns. Hypothesis of consolidation-specific schema benefit NOT supported visually.

### Figure 2: LMM Diagnostic Plots (4-Panel)

**Filename:** `step05_residual_diagnostics.png`
**Plot Type:** Four-panel diagnostic plot
**Generated By:** Step 5 assumption validation

**Panel Descriptions:**

**Top-Left: Q-Q Plot of Residuals**
- Residuals align closely with theoretical normal distribution line
- Slight departures at extreme tails (±3 quantiles)
- Shapiro-Wilk p = 0.394 (normality assumption MET)

**Top-Right: Residuals vs Fitted Values**
- Random scatter around y = 0 line expected for homoscedasticity
- **CONCERN:** Noticeable funnel pattern (variance increases with fitted values)
- Levene test p < 0.0001 (homoscedasticity assumption VIOLATED)
- Suggests heteroscedasticity issue requiring remedial action

**Bottom-Left: Q-Q Plot of Random Effects**
- Random intercepts and slopes align with normal distribution
- Minor departures at tails
- Shapiro-Wilk p = 0.022 (random effects normality borderline)

**Bottom-Right: Histogram of Residuals**
- Approximately normal distribution (bell curve shape)
- Slight negative skew
- Consistent with Q-Q plot findings (normality acceptable)

**Connection to Findings:**
Diagnostic plots reveal **homoscedasticity violation** (funnel pattern in residuals vs fitted). This suggests model may underestimate standard errors for participants with high/low fitted values. Random effects normality borderline but acceptable. Interpretation of significance tests should be cautious given heteroscedasticity.

## 3. Interpretation

### Hypothesis Testing

**Original Hypothesis (from 1_concept.md):**
"Congruent items will show less forgetting during the consolidation window (Day 0-1) compared to incongruent items, as schema-based memory benefits from sleep-dependent consolidation. The congruence effect may be less pronounced during later decay (Day 1-6)."

**Hypothesis Status:** **NOT SUPPORTED**

The statistical findings provide no evidence for differential consolidation:
- **Primary 3-way interaction:** Days_within × Segment[Late] × Congruence[Congruent]: ² = -0.018, SE = 0.226, p = .938 (uncorrected), p = 1.0 (Bonferroni)
- **Interpretation:** Congruent items do NOT show different slope patterns between Early and Late segments compared to Common items
- **Secondary 3-way interaction:** Days_within × Segment[Late] × Congruence[Incongruent]: ² = 0.060, p = .792 (also non-significant)

**Effect Magnitudes:**
Even at face value (ignoring non-significance), the 3-way interaction coefficient (-0.018) is trivially small. This represents a difference of only 0.018 theta units per day between Early and Late segments for Congruent vs Common slopes - far below any meaningful threshold.

### Theoretical Contextualization

**Sleep Consolidation Theory Prediction:**
Stickgold & Walker (2013) and Rasch & Born (2013) propose that schema-consistent memories preferentially benefit from hippocampal-neocortical dialogue during sleep. This RQ tested whether congruent items show less forgetting specifically during the Early segment (Days 0-1, including one night's sleep) compared to the Late segment (Days 1-6, post-consolidation decay).

**Why the Hypothesis Failed:**

1. **No Consolidation Window Benefit:** Congruent items did NOT show shallower slopes during Early segment compared to Common/Incongruent items. Early segment slope for Congruent (-0.253) is nearly identical to Common (-0.263).

2. **No Segment Differentiation:** The congruence effect (whatever small differences exist) does NOT differ between Early consolidation and Late decay phases. The 3-way interaction was essentially zero (² = -0.018, p = .938).

3. **Alternative Explanation:** Schema congruence may affect INITIAL ENCODING (Day 0 baseline differences) rather than consolidation processes. However, main effects of Congruence were also non-significant (Congruent vs Common: ² = -0.030, p = .746).

**Literature Connections (from rq_scholar validation):**

The null findings contrast with sleep consolidation literature predictions but align with alternative perspectives:

- **Bartlett (1932):** Schema effects primarily at encoding/retrieval, not necessarily consolidation
- **Ghosh & Gilboa (2014):** Schema facilitation may be context-dependent (VR paradigm may not engage schemas as expected)
- **McClelland et al. (1995):** Systems consolidation occurs over weeks/months, not within 24 hours - Day 0-1 window may be too early to detect schema-based consolidation benefits

### Unexpected Patterns

**1. Continuous Time Models Fit Better Than Piecewise**

**Finding:** Sensitivity analysis revealed that continuous time models, especially Linear+Log time, fit substantially better than the piecewise model:
- Piecewise (primary): AIC = 2581.55
- Linear time: AIC = 2590.48 (”AICThere= +9, worse)
- Logarithmic time: AIC = 2564.01 (”AICThere= -18, better)
- **Linear+Log time: AIC = 2490.91 (”AICThere= -91, MUCH better)**

**Interpretation:** The piecewise assumption (discrete regime change at Day 1) appears unjustified. Forgetting follows a smooth continuous trajectory (combination of linear and logarithmic decay) rather than distinct consolidation vs decay phases.

**Investigation Suggestion:** The theoretical rationale for Day 1 knot placement (one night's sleep) may not align with actual memory dynamics in this VR paradigm. Future analyses should use continuous time models (Linear+Log) as primary approach, treating piecewise segmentation as exploratory. This contradicts the core premise of the research question.

**2. Steeper Slopes in Early Segment (But Non-Significant)**

**Finding:** Early segment slopes (-0.25 to -0.32 theta/day) appear ~3× steeper than Late segment slopes (-0.09 to -0.10 theta/day), but Early slopes have very wide confidence intervals and are non-significant.

**Possible Explanations:**
- **Statistical:** Early segment only has 2 timepoints (Day 0, Day 1) vs 3 for Late (Day 1, 3, 6), reducing power
- **Methodological:** Days_within variable ranges differ (0-1 day for Early vs 0-6 days for Late), making slopes non-comparable
- **Biological:** May reflect genuine rapid initial forgetting (classic Ebbinghaus curve) followed by slower asymptotic decline - but this is a continuous process, not discrete segments

**Investigation Suggestion:** Reanalyze with continuous time models (already shown to fit better). Use log-transformed time to capture non-linear forgetting curve. Test whether schema congruence moderates overall forgetting rate rather than segment-specific slopes.

**3. Homoscedasticity Violation**

**Finding:** Levene test p < 0.0001 indicates variance of residuals increases with fitted values (funnel pattern in diagnostic plot).

**Possible Causes:**
- Heterogeneous item difficulty: Some congruence types may have more variable theta estimates (SE_congruent and SE_incongruent both 0.236, higher than SE_common)
- Individual differences: Some participants may show stable memory (low variance) while others show volatile forgetting (high variance)
- Model misspecification: Piecewise segmentation may create artificial variance patterns

**Investigation Suggestion:** Consider weighted least squares (WLS) LMM using inverse variance of theta estimates (1/SE²) as weights. This addresses heteroscedasticity by downweighting imprecise observations. Alternatively, robust standard errors could be computed to correct significance tests.

### Broader Implications

**REMEMVR Validation:**

This RQ provides a **null finding** for schema-based consolidation effects in VR episodic memory. Implications:

1. **Schema congruence may not modulate consolidation** in this VR paradigm
2. **Continuous time models more appropriate** than piecewise segmentation for modeling VR forgetting
3. **Sleep consolidation benefits** (if any) are not schema-specific or are too subtle to detect with N=100

**Methodological Insights:**

1. **Piecewise vs Continuous Modeling:** The 91-unit AIC difference favoring Linear+Log time is decisive. Piecewise models should not be used for VR forgetting trajectories unless strong theoretical justification exists. Future RQs should default to continuous time models.

2. **DERIVED Data Precision:** Using RQ 5.5 theta scores as outcome variable introduces measurement error (SE ~ 0.20-0.24). This may reduce power to detect subtle consolidation effects. Future analyses could weight by theta precision or use IRT response-level modeling.

3. **Sleep Consolidation Window Assumption:** The Day 0-1 window (one night's sleep) may be too narrow or mis-specified. Consolidation benefits may emerge over multiple nights or at different time scales. Alternative window definitions (e.g., 0-3 days) could be tested.

**Theoretical Implications:**

1. **Schema Theory Limitations:** Schema congruence effects observed in other paradigms (Ghosh & Gilboa, 2014) may not generalize to VR episodic memory. VR items may be too novel or context-specific to activate pre-existing schemas.

2. **Sleep Consolidation Mechanisms:** Hippocampal-neocortical dialogue during sleep (Rasch & Born, 2013) may not preferentially benefit schema-congruent memories in all contexts. Consolidation may be domain-general rather than schema-specific.

3. **Alternative Hypotheses:** Schema effects may occur at encoding (not tested here) or retrieval (interference/facilitation) rather than consolidation. Future RQs examining immediate post-encoding memory or retrieval cues may be more informative.

## 4. Limitations

### Sample Limitations

**Sample Size:**
- N = 100 participants provides adequate power (0.80) for medium effects (d e 0.5) but underpowered for small effects
- 3-way interaction effect size extremely small (² = -0.018), would require N > 1000 to detect reliably
- Early segment slopes have wide confidence intervals due to only 2 timepoints per participant

**Demographic Constraints:**
- Sample characteristics inherited from RQ 5.5 (undergraduate students, age ~20, predominantly female)
- Restricted to healthy young adults - generalizability to older adults or clinical populations unknown
- Sleep quality not measured - unable to verify that "one night's sleep" (Day 0-1) involved actual sleep consolidation

**Attrition:**
- No additional attrition beyond RQ 5.5 (DERIVED data source)
- Assumed all 100 participants completed all 4 test sessions with minimal missing data

### Methodological Limitations

**Measurement:**

1. **DERIVED Data Precision:**
   - Theta scores from RQ 5.5 have standard errors (SE ~ 0.20-0.24)
   - Measurement error in outcome variable reduces statistical power
   - No weighting by theta precision applied (assumes homogeneous measurement quality)

2. **Piecewise Segmentation:**
   - Day 1 knot placement theoretically motivated but empirically unjustified (continuous models fit better by ”AICThere= 91 units)
   - Early segment only 2 timepoints (Day 0, Day 1) limits slope estimation precision
   - Days_within variable ranges differ between segments (0-1 vs 0-6), making slopes non-comparable

3. **Congruence Categorization:**
   - Congruence types (Common/Congruent/Incongruent) defined at item level in RQ 5.5
   - Item-level congruence ratings not verified empirically (based on experimenter judgments)
   - May not align with participants' actual schemas

**Design:**

1. **No Sleep Measurement:**
   - Critical assumption: "one night's sleep" (Day 0-1) involves sleep consolidation
   - No sleep diaries, actigraphy, or polysomnography to verify sleep quality/quantity
   - Day 1 testing occurred ~22-26 hours post-encoding (TSVR), timing variability may dilute consolidation window

2. **Piecewise Assumption:**
   - Assumes discrete regime change at Day 1 (consolidation ’ decay transition)
   - Sensitivity analysis decisively rejects this assumption (continuous models fit better)
   - Theoretical prediction (consolidation window) not supported by data

3. **Cross-RQ Dependency:**
   - RQ 5.5 must complete successfully for this RQ to run (DERIVED data)
   - Any errors in RQ 5.5 IRT calibration propagate to this RQ
   - Unable to test alternative IRT specifications (locked into RQ 5.5 decisions)

**Statistical:**

1. **Homoscedasticity Violation:**
   - Levene test p < 0.0001 (variance of residuals increases with fitted values)
   - Funnel pattern in diagnostic plot suggests heteroscedasticity
   - Standard errors may be underestimated for high/low fitted values
   - Significance tests may be anticonservative (inflated Type I error)

2. **Random Effects Normality:**
   - Shapiro-Wilk p = 0.022 for random effects (borderline violation)
   - Acceptable given LMM robustness, but QQ plot shows tail departures
   - May affect random effect predictions (BLUPs less reliable)

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Piecewise model selected a priori based on hypothesis
   - Sensitivity analysis shows substantial model misspecification (”AICThere= 91 favors continuous time)
   - Results interpret a mis-specified model (conclusions may be invalid)

### Technical Limitations

**Piecewise LMM Specification:**
- Random slopes (Days_within | UID) at lower boundary for reliability (N=100 participants, Newsom recommends 100-200)
- Convergence successful but model complexity may be excessive given data
- Treatment coding (Common reference, Early reference) chosen arbitrarily

**Sensitivity Analyses:**
- Knot placement sensitivity NOT tested (deferred to future, per log)
- Inverse variance weighting NOT tested (deferred to future)
- Only continuous time models tested - substantial findings (Linear+Log best) but incomplete sensitivity coverage

**TSVR Variable (Decision D070):**
- Uses actual hours since VR encoding (continuous time)
- Days_within transformation (hours ’ days within segment) may introduce artifacts
- Early segment Days_within = (TSVR - 0)/24, Late segment Days_within = (TSVR - 24)/24
- Centering at segment starts creates discontinuity at Day 1 knot

**Validation Coverage:**
- Multicollinearity (VIF) NOT calculated (skipped in Step 5, per log)
- Sensitivity Analysis 2 (knot placement) NOT performed (complex implementation deferred)
- Sensitivity Analysis 3 (inverse variance weighting) NOT performed (complex implementation deferred)

### Generalizability Constraints

**Population:**
- Findings limited to healthy young adults (undergraduates)
- Sleep consolidation effects may differ in older adults (sleep quality declines with age)
- Clinical populations (insomnia, sleep apnea) not represented

**Context:**
- VR paradigm-specific - may not generalize to real-world episodic memory
- Desktop VR (not fully immersive HMD) may engage different consolidation mechanisms
- Laboratory sleep (participants went home) vs controlled sleep environment

**Task:**
- Congruence effects specific to REMEMVR item content
- May not reflect schema-based consolidation in other memory domains (verbal, spatial navigation)
- Encoding task highly structured (may not reflect naturalistic episodic encoding)

### Limitations Summary

Despite these constraints, findings are **decisive within scope:**
- Null 3-way interaction (p = .938) is not due to low power - effect size is essentially zero (² = -0.018)
- Sensitivity analysis provides strong evidence against piecewise assumption (”AICThere= 91 favors continuous time)
- Homoscedasticity violation is a concern, but null result unlikely to be artifact (heteroscedasticity typically inflates Type I error, not create false negatives)

**Key Limitation:** Piecewise model is mis-specified. Results should be interpreted as testing an unsupported theoretical assumption rather than definitive evidence against schema-based consolidation. Future analyses should use continuous time models (Linear+Log) as primary approach.

## 5. Next Steps

### Immediate Follow-Ups (Current Data)

**1. Reanalyze with Continuous Time Models (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Rationale:** Sensitivity analysis shows Linear+Log time model fits 91 AIC units better than piecewise. Current results may be invalid due to model misspecification.

**Approach:**
- Fit LMM with formula: `theta ~ TSVR_hours + log(TSVR_hours + 1) × Congruence + (1 + TSVR_hours | UID)`
- Test whether Congruence moderates overall forgetting rate (continuous) rather than segment-specific slopes
- Compare to piecewise results: Does continuous model detect congruence effects missed by piecewise?

**Expected Insight:** Continuous models may reveal subtle schema effects distributed across entire 6-day trajectory rather than localized to Day 0-1 consolidation window.

**Timeline:** Immediate (same data, alternative model specification - ~1 day to implement and validate)

---

**2. Weighted LMM to Address Heteroscedasticity (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**Rationale:** Homoscedasticity violation (Levene p < 0.0001) may bias standard errors. Theta estimates have known precision (SE from RQ 5.5).

**Approach:**
- Weight observations by inverse variance: `weight = 1 / SE²`
- Refit piecewise LMM with weights: `fit_lmm(..., weights=1/SE**2)`
- Compare weighted vs unweighted results: Do conclusions change?

**Expected Insight:** Weighting downweights imprecise theta estimates, potentially tightening confidence intervals and revealing effects masked by heteroscedasticity.

**Timeline:** Immediate (~1-2 hours to implement, already have SE values in data)

---

**3. Test Alternative Consolidation Windows (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

**Rationale:** Day 0-1 window assumption may be too narrow or mis-specified. Consolidation may occur over multiple nights.

**Approach:**
- Test alternative knot placements: Day 0.5, Day 1.5, Day 3
- Fit piecewise models for each knot, compare AIC
- If AIC improvements found: Re-test 3-way interaction with optimal knot

**Expected Insight:** Determine whether consolidation window exists at different time scale than predicted. May reveal that Day 3 (two nights sleep) is critical window.

**Timeline:** Medium (~2-3 days to implement knot placement sensitivity systematically)

---

**4. Individual Differences in Consolidation Benefit (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

**Rationale:** Sleep quality varies across individuals. Some participants may show consolidation benefit while others don't (averaging cancels effect).

**Approach:**
- Extract participant-specific random slopes for Early and Late segments
- Cluster participants: "consolidation benefiters" (Early slope shallower than Late) vs "non-benefiters"
- Test whether congruence effects differ between clusters

**Expected Insight:** Schema-based consolidation may be individual-dependent. Subgroup analysis could reveal effects masked in population average.

**Timeline:** Medium (~3-4 days to implement clustering analysis and post-hoc tests)

---

### Planned Thesis RQs (Chapter 5 Continuation)

**RQ 5.7: Practice Effects vs Forgetting (Planned)**

**Focus:** Separate testing effects (retrieval practice benefits) from forgetting decay across 4 test sessions

**Builds On:** RQ 5.6 continuous time finding (Linear+Log model best) suggests forgetting is not simple linear decay. Practice effects may interact with time.

**Rationale:** Four repeated retrievals (T1-T4) may alter forgetting trajectory via testing effect (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006). Current RQ assumes forgetting-only; RQ 5.7 will model practice effects explicitly.

**Expected Timeline:** 2-3 RQs ahead (after addressing immediate follow-ups)

---

**RQ 5.8: Domain × Congruence Interaction (Exploratory)**

**Focus:** Test whether schema congruence effects differ across memory domains (What/Where/When)

**Builds On:** RQ 5.6 found no main congruence effect, but domain-specific effects not tested. Spatial memory (Where) may benefit more from schema congruence than temporal (When).

**Rationale:** Schemas may be domain-specific (spatial landmarks vs object categories vs temporal sequences). Cross-domain analysis could reveal localized effects.

**Expected Timeline:** Dependent on RQ 5.7 completion, 3-4 RQs ahead

---

### Methodological Extensions (Future Data Collection)

**1. Measure Sleep Quality (Consolidation Verification)**

**Current Limitation:** "One night's sleep" (Day 0-1) assumed but not verified. Participants went home, sleep quality unknown.

**Extension:**
- Collect sleep diaries (self-report bedtime, wake time, quality rating)
- Add actigraphy (wrist-worn device tracks sleep/wake objectively)
- Test whether sleep quality moderates consolidation benefit (participants with better sleep show stronger congruence effects in Early segment)

**Expected Insight:** Verify that Day 0-1 window actually involves sleep consolidation. May explain null result if participants had poor sleep.

**Feasibility:** Requires new data collection cohort with sleep monitoring (~6 months, N=50 subsample)

---

**2. Test Schema Congruence at Encoding vs Consolidation**

**Current Limitation:** Schema effects may occur at encoding (not tested here) rather than consolidation. RQ 5.6 examined post-encoding slopes only.

**Extension:**
- Add immediate post-encoding test (within 5 minutes of VR session)
- Compare: Congruent vs Incongruent performance at encoding (before any consolidation)
- Test: Does schema facilitate initial encoding, or does benefit emerge during consolidation?

**Expected Insight:** Distinguish encoding-based schema effects (Bartlett, 1932) from consolidation-based effects (Rasch & Born, 2013). May explain null consolidation findings.

**Feasibility:** Requires new participants and modified protocol (add immediate test - ~3 months, N=100 new sample)

---

**3. Polysomnography Study (Mechanistic Consolidation Test)**

**Current Limitation:** Sleep consolidation mechanisms (hippocampal-neocortical dialogue) not directly measured. Behavioral forgetting curves are indirect proxies.

**Extension:**
- Conduct sleep study with polysomnography (PSG) during Night 1 (Day 0-1 window)
- Measure: Slow-wave sleep (SWS), REM sleep, sleep spindles
- Test: Do participants with more SWS show stronger consolidation benefit for congruent items?

**Expected Insight:** Direct mechanistic test of sleep consolidation theory prediction. Would provide neural validation (or refutation) of schema-based consolidation hypothesis.

**Feasibility:** Long-term collaboration with sleep lab (1-2 years, N=30 PSG subsample, ~$50k equipment/personnel costs)

---

### Theoretical Questions Raised

**1. Are Schemas Engaged in VR Episodic Memory?**

**Question:** RQ 5.6 found no schema congruence effects (either consolidation-specific or general). Does this mean VR items don't activate pre-existing schemas, or schemas don't modulate memory in this paradigm?

**Next Steps:**
- Manipulation check: Ask participants to rate schema congruence post-hoc ("How well did this item fit your expectations?")
- Compare experimenter-defined congruence (RQ 5.5) to participant-rated congruence
- Test: Do participant-rated schemas predict memory better than experimenter-defined?

**Expected Insight:** If participant ratings differ from experimenter classifications, null results may be due to schema definition error rather than absence of schema effects.

**Feasibility:** Moderate (requires post-hoc data collection from participants - ~1 month, N=100)

---

**2. Is Sleep Consolidation Schema-Specific or Domain-General?**

**Question:** Sleep consolidation theory predicts schema-congruent memories benefit more from sleep (Rasch & Born, 2013). But null 3-way interaction suggests consolidation is domain-general. Which is correct?

**Next Steps:**
- Meta-analysis: Examine sleep consolidation studies testing schema effects
- Experimental: Replicate with paradigm known to show schema effects (DRM false memory, schema-consistent vs -inconsistent stories)
- Test: Is VR-specific null result or schema-consolidation link weaker than literature suggests?

**Expected Insight:** Determine whether null results are paradigm-specific (VR doesn't engage schemas) or theoretical (sleep consolidation is not schema-specific).

**Feasibility:** Literature review immediate, experimental replication ~6 months

---

**3. Do Piecewise Models Ever Fit Memory Data?**

**Question:** Continuous time models (Linear+Log) fit decisively better (”AICThere= 91 units). When, if ever, are piecewise segmentation models justified for forgetting trajectories?

**Next Steps:**
- Systematic model comparison across all Chapter 5 RQs (RQ 5.1-5.8)
- Test: Do ANY RQs show piecewise advantage, or is continuous time universally superior?
- Methodological implications: Should thesis abandon piecewise models entirely?

**Expected Insight:** Determine whether piecewise segmentation is fundamentally inappropriate for VR forgetting data. May justify using continuous time models as default for all future RQs.

**Feasibility:** Immediate (apply sensitivity analyses to existing RQ outputs - ~1 week)

---

### Priority Ranking

**High Priority (Do First):**
1. **Reanalyze with Continuous Time Models** - Addresses model misspecification (”AICThere= 91), highest impact
2. **Weighted LMM** - Fixes homoscedasticity violation, ensures valid inference
3. **Test Alternative Consolidation Windows** - May reveal consolidation benefit at different time scale

**Medium Priority (Subsequent):**
1. **Individual Differences in Consolidation** - Explores heterogeneity, may explain null average effect
2. **RQ 5.7 (Practice Effects)** - Natural next step in thesis, tests alternative forgetting mechanisms
3. **Schema Manipulation Check** - Validates congruence categorization, addresses potential measurement error

**Lower Priority (Aspirational):**
1. **Sleep Quality Measurement** - Requires new data collection, valuable but not critical for current thesis
2. **Immediate Post-Encoding Test** - Tests alternative hypothesis (encoding vs consolidation), new cohort needed
3. **Polysomnography Study** - Long-term mechanistic validation, outside thesis scope but important for field

### Next Steps Summary

The findings reveal **decisive evidence against piecewise segmentation** (continuous time models fit 91 AIC units better) and **null hypothesis for schema-based consolidation** (3-way interaction p = .938). Three critical immediate follow-ups:

1. **Reanalyze with Linear+Log continuous time model** (addresses model misspecification)
2. **Apply inverse variance weighting** (addresses homoscedasticity violation)
3. **Test alternative consolidation windows** (Day 3 knot may reveal delayed consolidation benefit)

If all three analyses confirm null congruence effects, conclude that schema-based sleep consolidation does NOT occur in VR episodic memory (at least not within 6-day window). Theoretical implications: VR items may not engage schemas, or schemas don't modulate consolidation in this paradigm.
