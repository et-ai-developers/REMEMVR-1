[START] Step 04: Reliability Assessment
[LOAD] Loading raw item-level data...
[LOADED] Raw data: 400 rows, 214 columns
[LOAD] Loading item mapping...
[LOADED] Item mapping: 45 items
[LOAD] Loading full item list from RQ 5.3.1...
[LOADED] Full item list: 72 items
[ORGANIZE] Organizing items by paradigm...
[PARADIGM] IFR: 24 full items, 12 purified items
[PARADIGM] ICR: 24 full items, 19 purified items
[PARADIGM] IRE: 24 full items, 14 purified items
[ANALYSIS] Computing Cronbach's alpha with bootstrap CIs...

[PARADIGM] Processing IFR...
[ALPHA] Computing alpha_full for IFR (24 items)...
[ALPHA] alpha_full = 0.442 [0.345, 0.522]
[ALPHA] Computing alpha_purified for IFR (12 items)...
[ALPHA] alpha_purified = 0.584 [0.524, 0.634]
[SPEARMAN-BROWN] Adjusting purified alpha to full item count...
[SPEARMAN-BROWN] alpha_purified_SB_adjusted = 0.737
[DELTA] delta_alpha = 0.142 (purified - full)

[PARADIGM] Processing ICR...
[ALPHA] Computing alpha_full for ICR (24 items)...
[ALPHA] alpha_full = 0.655 [0.603, 0.700]
[ALPHA] Computing alpha_purified for ICR (19 items)...
[ALPHA] alpha_purified = 0.651 [0.599, 0.696]
[SPEARMAN-BROWN] Adjusting purified alpha to full item count...
[SPEARMAN-BROWN] alpha_purified_SB_adjusted = 0.702
[DELTA] delta_alpha = -0.004 (purified - full)

[PARADIGM] Processing IRE...
[ALPHA] Computing alpha_full for IRE (24 items)...
[ALPHA] alpha_full = 0.608 [0.547, 0.656]
[ALPHA] Computing alpha_purified for IRE (14 items)...
[ALPHA] alpha_purified = 0.564 [0.498, 0.618]
[SPEARMAN-BROWN] Adjusting purified alpha to full item count...
[SPEARMAN-BROWN] alpha_purified_SB_adjusted = 0.689
[DELTA] delta_alpha = -0.044 (purified - full)

[SAVE] Saving reliability assessment results...
[SAVED] /home/etai/projects/REMEMVR/results/ch5/5.3.6/data/step04_reliability_assessment.csv
[SAVED] 3 rows (3 paradigms)

[VALIDATION] Validating results...
[VALIDATION] PASS: All 3 paradigms present
[VALIDATION] PASS: alpha_full in [0, 1]
[VALIDATION] PASS: alpha_purified in [0, 1]
[VALIDATION] PASS: alpha_purified_SB_adjusted in [0, 1]
[VALIDATION] PASS: All CIs contain alpha values
[VALIDATION] PASS: n_items_purified <= n_items_full
[VALIDATION] PASS: No NaN values

[SUCCESS] Step 04 complete - All validations passed
