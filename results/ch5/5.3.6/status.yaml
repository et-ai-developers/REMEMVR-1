    RQ 5.3.6: Purified CTT Effects (Paradigms)
    Type: Paradigms / Purified CTT comparison
    Analysis: CTT scoring (Full vs Purified) + Steiger's z-test + LMM + AIC comparison
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.3.1 (purified items, theta) + RAW (dfData.csv for full CTT)
    Critical: 8 steps, Cronbach's alpha, dual p-values (D068), z-standardized LMMs

    RQ 5.3.6 validated: 9.4/10 APPROVED. Solid measurement theory, CTT/IRT convergent validity framework sound. Minor gaps on practice effects confound and IRT scale equating. 8 scholarly concerns identified (3 CRITICAL). All addressable without revision. Ready for rq_stats.

    RE-VALIDATED 2025-12-02. Updated: 9.15/10 CONDITIONAL → 9.9/10 APPROVED.
    All 3 required changes addressed: (1) Convergence Contingency Plan (LRT fallback per Bates 2015),
    (2) Steiger's Z-Test Assumptions (Mardia's test, linearity, bootstrap remedials),
    (3) Cronbach's alpha Spearman-Brown interpretation. All categories improved:
    Cat1 3.0/3 (+0.2), Cat2 1.9/2 (unchanged), Cat3 2.0/2 (+0.1), Cat4 2.0/2 (+0.2), Cat5 1.0/1 (+0.2).
    No new concerns. Ready for rq_planner.
