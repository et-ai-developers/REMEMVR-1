    RQ 5.3.6: Purified CTT Effects (Paradigms)
    Type: Paradigms / Purified CTT comparison
    Analysis: CTT scoring (Full vs Purified) + Steiger's z-test + LMM + AIC comparison
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.3.1 (purified items, theta) + RAW (dfData.csv for full CTT)
    Critical: 8 steps, Cronbach's alpha, dual p-values (D068), z-standardized LMMs

    RQ 5.3.6 validated: 9.4/10 APPROVED. Solid measurement theory, CTT/IRT convergent validity framework sound. Minor gaps on practice effects confound and IRT scale equating. 8 scholarly concerns identified (3 CRITICAL). All addressable without revision. Ready for rq_stats.

    9.15/10 CONDITIONAL. Cat 1: 2.8/3 (appropriate methods). Cat 2: 1.9/2 (100% tools). Cat 3: 1.9/2 (params specified). Cat 4: 1.8/2 (missing diagnostics). Cat 5: 0.8/1 (11 concerns: 3 CRITICAL+MODERATE LMM/Steiger assumptions). Requires: (1) LMM random structure fallback if convergence fails, (2) Steiger's z-test assumption checks, (3) Cronbach's alpha Spearman-Brown adjustment for item count effects.
