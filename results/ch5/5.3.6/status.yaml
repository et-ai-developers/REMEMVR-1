    RQ 5.3.6: Purified CTT Effects (Paradigms)
    Type: Paradigms / Purified CTT comparison
    Analysis: CTT scoring (Full vs Purified) + Steiger's z-test + LMM + AIC comparison
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.3.1 (purified items, theta) + RAW (dfData.csv for full CTT)
    Critical: 8 steps, Cronbach's alpha, dual p-values (D068), z-standardized LMMs

    RQ 5.3.6 validated: 9.4/10 APPROVED. Solid measurement theory, CTT/IRT convergent validity framework sound. Minor gaps on practice effects confound and IRT scale equating. 8 scholarly concerns identified (3 CRITICAL). All addressable without revision. Ready for rq_stats.

    RE-VALIDATED 2025-12-02. Updated: 9.15/10 CONDITIONAL → 9.9/10 APPROVED.
    All 3 required changes addressed: (1) Convergence Contingency Plan (LRT fallback per Bates 2015),
    (2) Steiger's Z-Test Assumptions (Mardia's test, linearity, bootstrap remedials),
    (3) Cronbach's alpha Spearman-Brown interpretation. All categories improved:
    Cat1 3.0/3 (+0.2), Cat2 1.9/2 (unchanged), Cat3 2.0/2 (+0.1), Cat4 2.0/2 (+0.2), Cat5 1.0/1 (+0.2).
    No new concerns. Ready for rq_planner.

rq_planner:

  context_dump: |
    Analysis plan created: 9 steps planned (Step 0: dependency validation + Steps 1-8: analysis).
    Tool requirements: CTT scoring (Full/Purified), Cronbach's alpha (bootstrap CIs), Steiger's z-test (D068 dual p-values), z-standardization, LMM (9 models: 3 paradigms x 3 measurement types), AIC comparison.
    Expected outputs: 13 data files (item mapping, CTT scores, reliability, correlation, LMM comparison, plot data), 9 log files. Validation required at every step.
    Cross-RQ dependency: RQ 5.3.1 (purified items, theta, TSVR). Estimated runtime: 30-90 minutes (dominated by bootstrap and LMM fitting).

rq_tools:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    8 analysis + 8 validation tools cataloged for CTT purification comparison analysis
    Tools: CTT scoring, Cronbach's alpha, Steiger's z-test, z-standardization, LMM fitting
    D068 compliance: validate_contrasts_d068 enforces dual p-value reporting
    Cross-RQ: check_file_exists validates RQ 5.3.1 dependency files exist

rq_analysis:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9 steps specified with validation (CTT 2-type comparison -> Cronbach's alpha -> Steiger's z-test -> z-standardization -> 9 LMM models -> AIC comparison -> plot data)
    All steps have analysis + validation calls with full signatures
    Dual p-value reporting (D068) enforced via validate_contrasts_d068
    Cross-RQ dependency validation (RQ 5.3.1) in Step 0
