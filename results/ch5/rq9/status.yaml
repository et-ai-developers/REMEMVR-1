    RQ 5.9: Age effects on baseline memory and forgetting rate
    Domains: All (What/Where/When combined composite)
    Analysis: LMM (Age × Time interaction, Lin+Log functional form)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.7 theta scores + Age from dfData.csv
    Critical: Age grand-mean centered, Bonferroni α=0.0033, Age tertiles for visualization

    9.0/10 CONDITIONAL. Theory excellent (3.0/3.0), literature dated (1.7/2.0 - all pre-2015). CRITICAL omission: practice effects unaddressed. 15 papers reviewed (8 high-relevance 2020-2024). Add recent cites + practice discussion -> APPROVED. Ready for stats validation.

rq_stats:
  status: success

    9.5/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 3.0/3 (appropriate). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 2.0/2 (Bonferroni α=0.0033 for 3 tests should be 0.0167, overly conservative). Cat4: 1.8/2 (convergence diagnostics missing). Cat5: 0.7/1 (6 concerns, below 8+ target).

    6 analysis steps planned (Step 0: data merge + Steps 1-5: LMM analysis)
    Tool requirements: LMM fitting (Age x Time interaction), effect extraction, effect size computation, plot data preparation
    Expected outputs: 7 data files, 6 result files, 2 plot source CSVs. Validation required at every step.
    Cross-RQ dependency: RQ 5.7 (theta scores for "All" composite factor + TSVR mapping)

    FAIL - Missing Analysis Tools (TDD Detection Point)

    Required Analysis Tools (from 2_plan.md):
    Step 2: fit_lmm_trajectory_tsvr (FOUND in tools.analysis_lmm)
    Step 2: extract_fixed_effects_from_lmm (FOUND in tools.analysis_lmm)
    Step 3: extract_age_effects_with_bonferroni (NOT FOUND - custom needed)
    Step 4: compute_age_effect_sizes_from_lmm (NOT FOUND - custom needed)
    Step 5: prepare_age_effects_plot_data (FOUND in tools.analysis_lmm)

    Missing from tools_inventory.md:
    1. extract_age_effects_with_bonferroni
       - Purpose: Extract Age-related fixed effects, apply Bonferroni correction
       - Expected signature: extract_age_effects_with_bonferroni(fixed_effects_df: DataFrame, age_terms: List[str], n_tests: int, alpha: float) -> DataFrame
       - Outputs: DataFrame with term, coef, se, z, p_uncorrected, p_bonferroni, significant_bonferroni columns
       - Decision D068 compliance: Dual p-value reporting

    2. compute_age_effect_sizes_from_lmm
       - Purpose: Compute Age effect sizes as theta difference for 1 SD Age increase
       - Expected signature: compute_age_effect_sizes_from_lmm(lmm_result: MixedLMResults, age_sd: float, reference_time: float) -> DataFrame
       - Outputs: DataFrame with metric, value, unit, interpretation columns
       - Rationale: Quantify Age effects in interpretable units

    Required Validation Tools (from 2_plan.md):
    Step 0: validate_data_merge (NOT FOUND - custom needed)
    Step 1: validate_centering_transformation (NOT FOUND - custom needed)
    Step 2: validate_lmm_convergence (FOUND in tools.validation)
    Step 2: validate_lmm_residuals (FOUND in tools.validation)
    Step 3: validate_hypothesis_test_dual_pvalues (FOUND in tools.validation)
    Step 4: validate_effect_sizes (FOUND in tools.validation)
    Step 5: validate_plot_data_completeness (FOUND in tools.validation)

    Missing from tools_inventory.md:
    3. validate_data_merge
       - Purpose: Validate merge success (no missing values, expected row count)
       - Expected signature: validate_data_merge(df: DataFrame, expected_rows: int, no_nan_cols: List[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]
       - Checks: Row count, NaN detection, duplicate keys

    4. validate_centering_transformation
       - Purpose: Validate grand-mean centering (mean ~ 0) and transformations
       - Expected signature: validate_centering_transformation(df: DataFrame, centered_col: str, transformation_specs: Dict) -> Dict[str, Any]
       - Checks: Centered variable mean in [-0.01, 0.01], transformation formulas correct

    Action Required:
    1. User + Claude migrate 4 missing tools from v3.0 OR create new with TDD
    2. Update tools_inventory.md with function signatures
    3. Re-run rq_tools agent

    This is the TDD detection point per rq_tools circuit breaker CB1 (TOOL_NOT_FOUND).
    DO NOT IMPROVISE. DO NOT GUESS SIGNATURES.
