    RQ 5.9: Age effects on baseline memory and forgetting rate
    Domains: All (What/Where/When combined composite)
    Analysis: LMM (Age × Time interaction, Lin+Log functional form)
    Data: DERIVED from RQ 5.7 theta scores + Age from dfData.csv
    Critical: Age grand-mean centered, Bonferroni α=0.0033, Age tertiles for visualization

    9.0/10 CONDITIONAL. Theory excellent (3.0/3.0), literature dated (1.7/2.0 - all pre-2015). CRITICAL omission: practice effects unaddressed. 15 papers reviewed (8 high-relevance 2020-2024). Add recent cites + practice discussion -> APPROVED. Ready for stats validation.

rq_stats:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    9.5/10 APPROVED. Cat1: 3.0/3 (appropriate). Cat2: 2.0/2 (100% reuse). Cat3: 2.0/2 (Bonferroni α=0.0033 for 3 tests should be 0.0167, overly conservative). Cat4: 1.8/2 (convergence diagnostics missing). Cat5: 0.7/1 (6 concerns, below 8+ target).

rq_planner:
  status: success
  context_dump: |
    6 analysis steps planned (Step 0: data merge + Steps 1-5: LMM analysis)
    Tool requirements: LMM fitting (Age x Time interaction), effect extraction, effect size computation, plot data preparation
    Expected outputs: 7 data files, 6 result files, 2 plot source CSVs. Validation required at every step.
    Cross-RQ dependency: RQ 5.7 (theta scores for "All" composite factor + TSVR mapping)

  context_dump: |
    0 analysis + 5 validation tools cataloged for LMM-only Age effects analysis
    All stdlib functions (pandas, statsmodels) exempt from catalog
    Validation tools: validate_data_format, validate_model_convergence, validate_contrasts_d068, validate_effect_sizes, validate_probability_range
