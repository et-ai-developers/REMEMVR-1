RQ 5.4.1 - Model Averaging Summary (Congruence × Time)
================================================================================

Problem: Best single model uncertainty
  Best model: PowerLaw_01
  Akaike weight: 0.0604 (6.0%)
  Interpretation: EXTREME uncertainty (6.04% << 30% threshold)

Solution: Multi-model inference (Burnham & Anderson, 2002)
  Models averaged: 15
  Effective N models: 13.96
  Cumulative weight: 56.4%

Models Used (Top 10):
   1. PowerLaw_01               w=0.1071
   2. Log                       w=0.1018
   3. Log2                      w=0.1018
   4. Log10                     w=0.1018
   5. PowerLaw_02               w=0.0890
   6. SquareRoot                w=0.0691
   7. Exp_slow                  w=0.0691
   8. PowerLaw_03               w=0.0589
   9. Log+Recip                 w=0.0469
  10. Recip+PowerLaw05          w=0.0439

Model Composition:
  Reciprocal family: 3 models (two-process forgetting)
  Power-law family: 6 models (scale-invariant decay)
  Logarithmic family: 6 models (Ebbinghaus curves)

Effective Functional Form:
  Mixed ensemble: Power-law (α≈0.1-0.3) + Logarithmic + Reciprocal
  Interpretation: No single functional form dominates
  Schema interaction: Time transformation × Congruence effects

Robustness:
  Single-model risk: Overfitting, ignores uncertainty
  Averaged approach: Accounts for functional form uncertainty
  Ph.D. defense: Scientifically defensible foundation

Comparison to Previous Steps:
  Original 5-model: Log 99.98% (overconfident by 5,882×)
  Extended 17-model: Recip+Log 73.7% (strong but incomplete)
  Kitchen sink 66-model: PowerLaw_01 6.04% (reveals true uncertainty)
  This step: Model averaging addresses uncertainty
